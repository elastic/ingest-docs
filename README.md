Home for Elastic ingest documentation

## Backporting

Pull requests should be tagged with the target version of the Elastic Stack along with any relevant backport labels. In general, we only backport documentation changes to [live stack versions](https://github.com/elastic/docs/blob/master/conf.yaml#L80). If you need help, ping **[ingest-docs](https://github.com/orgs/elastic/teams/ingest-docs)** and we'd be happy to handle the backport process for you.
