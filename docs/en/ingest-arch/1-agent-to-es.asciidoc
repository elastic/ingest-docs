== {agent} to {es}

TIP: You can host {es} on your own hardware or send your data to {es} on {ecloud}. 
For most users, {agent} writing directly to {es} on {ecloud} provides the easiest and fastest time to value. {ess-leadin-short}

To ingest data into {es}, use the _simplest option that meets your needs_ and satisfies your use case.
For many users and use cases, the simplest approach is ingesting data with {agent} and sending it to {es}.
{agent} and https://www.elastic.co/integrations/[{agent} integrations] are available for many popular platforms and services, and are a good place to start. 

Integrations offer advantages beyond easier data collection--advantages such as dashboards, central agent management, and easy enablement of https://www.elastic.co/products/[Elastic solutions], such as Security and Observability.
