=== {agent} to {ls} (for enrichment) to {es}

image::images/ea-ls-enrich.png[Image showing {agent} collecting data, sending to {ls} for enrichment before sending to {es}]

Ingest models::
* {agent} to {es} using {ls} to enrich the data
* {agent} to {ls} for enrichment based on fields in the {agent} data to {es}

Use when::
* Data enrichment in {es} is not practical for business or technical reasons
* Your use case requires data enrichment based on fields in the {agent} data.
{ls} can collect enrichment data based on those fields, and then send the data to {es}.

Examples::
* Data that changes frequently and is updated using an external source, such as stock ticker data
* Enrichment data is proprietary and cannot be stored elsewhere. 
* Enrichment is done with an HTTP API whose return depends on values from the document. +
Example: An API that takes geo points with the collected data and returns available real estate in the region, and then passes to {ls} enrichment for enrichment between agents and {es}.
