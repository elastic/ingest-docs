[[ls-enrich]]
== 10. {agent} to {ls} (for enrichment) to {es}

Ingest model::
{agent} to {es} using {ls} to enrich the data

Use when::
Data enrichment in {es} is not practical for business or technical reasons

Examples::
* Data sources that change frequently, such as stock ticker data
* Enrichment data is proprietary and cannot be stored elsewhere. 
(In this case, you can insert Logstash between agents and {es}.)

**ToDo** +
Add image: Agent to Logstash to ES showing Logstash reaching out to an external source to collect enrichment data, doing the enrichment and then sending it to ES
