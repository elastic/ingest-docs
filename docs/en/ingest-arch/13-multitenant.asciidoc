=== {agent} to {ls} for routing to multiple {es} clusters and additional destinations

image::images/ea-ls-multi.png[Image showing {agent} collecting and routing data to multiple destinations]

Ingest model::
{agent} to {ls} to {es} clusters and/or additional destinations

Use when::
Data collected by {agent} needs to be routed to different {es} clusters or non-{es} destinations depending on the content

Example::
Letâ€™s take an example of a Windows workstation, for which we are collecting different types of logs using the System and Windows integrations. 
These logs need to be sent to different {es} clusters and to S3 for backup and a mechanism to send it to other destinations such as different SIEM solutions. In addition, the {es} destination is derived based on the type of datastream and an organization identifier. 
+
In such use cases, agents send the data to {ls} as a routing mechanism to different destinations. 
Note that the System and Windows integrations must be installed on all {es} clusters to which the data is routed.

Sample config::
+ 
[source,ruby]
input {
  elastic_agent {
    port => 5044
  }
}
output {
  elasticsearch {
    cloud_id => "<cloud id>"
    api_key => "<api key>"
  }
  elasticsearch {
    cloud_id => "<cloud id>"
    api_key => "<api key>"
  }
   s3 {
     access_key_id => "my_key" 
     secret_access_key => "my_access_key"
     bucket => "our_bucket"
   }
  }
}
