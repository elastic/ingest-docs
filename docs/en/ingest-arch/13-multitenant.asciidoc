=== 13. {agent} to {ls} for routing to multiple {es} clusters and/or additional destinations

Ingest model::
{agent} to {ls} to {es} clusters and/or additional destinations

Use when::
Data collected by {agent} needs to be routed to different {es} clusters or non-{es} destinations depending on the content

Example::
Letâ€™s take an example of a Windows workstation, for which we are collecting different types of logs using the System and Windows integrations. 
These logs need to be sent to different {es} clusters and to S3 for backup and a mechanism to send it to other destinations such as different SIEM solutions. In addition, the {es} destination is derived based on the type of datastream and an organization identifier. 
+
In such use cases, agents send the data to {ls} as a routing mechanism to different destinations. 
Note that the System and Windows integrations must be installed on all {es} clusters to which the data is routed.

**ToDo:** 

* Add image showing Agent to LS to [Destination1, Destination2, ..] 
* Add config example/logic in Logstash for routing data to different destinations
