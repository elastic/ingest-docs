=== {agent} to {ls} to {es}: {ls} to bridge networks

image::images/ea-ls-bridge.png[Image showing {agent}s collecting data and sending to {ls} for proxying before sending on to {es}]

Ingest model::
Data path: {agent} to {ls} as bridge to {es} on {stack} network +
Control path: {agent} to {fleet-server} to {es}

Use when::
Agents have network restrictions for connecting to {es} on {stack} deployed outside of the agent network

Example::
You can send data from multiple {agent}s through your demilitarized zone (DMZ) to {ls}, and then use {ls} as a proxy through your firewall to {ess}. 
This approach helps reduce the number of firewall exceptions needed to forward data from large numbers of {agent}s.
