Ingest model::
 +
Control path for {fleet-server} on {ecloud}: {agent} to proxy to {fleet-server} to {es} +
Control path for self-managed {fleet-server}: {agent} to {fleet-server} to proxy to {es} +
Data path: {agent} to proxy to {es}

Use when::
* Network restrictions prevent connection between {agent} network and network where {fleet-server} and {stack} are deployed, as when {fleet-server} is deployed on {ecloud}
* Network restrictions prevent connection between {agent} and {fleet-server} network and the network where {stack} is deployed, as when {stack} is deployed on {ecloud}

Currently {agent} is not able to present a certificate for connectivity to {fleet-server}. Therefore if a proxy placed between the {agent} and {fleet-server} is configured for mutual TLS, {agents} won't be able
to establish connectivity to the {fleet server}.
