TIP: This architecture works with a variety of proxying tools to allow for more flexibility in your environment.
Consider using <<ls-networkbridge,{ls} as proxy>> when it is feasable for your use case.
{ls} and the rest of the {stack} are designed and tested to work together, and can be easier to support. 

Ingest model::
 +
Control path for {fleet-server} on {ecloud}: {agent} to proxy to {fleet-server} to {es} +
Control path for self-managed {fleet-server}: {agent} to {fleet-server} to proxy to {es} +
Data path: {agent} to proxy to {es}

Use when::
* Network restrictions prevent connection between {agent} network and network where {fleet-server} and {stack} are deployed, as when {fleet-server} is deployed on {ecloud}
* Network restrictions prevent connection between {agent} and {fleet-server} network and the network where {stack} is deployed, as when {stack} is deployed on {ecloud}
* Using <<ls-networkbridge,{ls} as proxy>> is not feasible.
