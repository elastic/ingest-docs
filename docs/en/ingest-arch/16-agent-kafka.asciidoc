== {agent} to {es} with Kafka as middleware message queue

image::images/ea-kafka.png[Image showing {agent} collecting data and using Kafka as a message queue enroute to {es}]

Ingest models::
<<agent-kafka-ls,{agent} to {ls} to Kafka to {ls} to {es}: Kafka as middleware message queue>>. +
{ls} reads data from Kafka and routes it to {es} clusters (and/or other destinations).
+
<<agent-kafka-essink,{agent} to {ls} to Kafka to Kafka ES Sink to {es}: Kafka as middleware message queue>>. +
Kafka ES sink connector reads from Kafka and writes to {es}.


Use when::
You are standardizing on Kafka as middleware message queue between {agent} and {es}

Notes:: 
The transformation from raw data to Elastic Common Schema (ECS) and any other enrichment can be handled by {ls} as described in <<ls-enrich>>.
