== 3. Schema modification on collected data


* 3. When you want to modify the schema for collected data 
** It is often necessary to modify the schema of collected data to make it more meaningful during analysis. A few examples include parsing additional fields from the collected data, normalizing attributes by renaming fields, creating a new field based on values of existing ones, and enriching documents with metadata (such as host/container metadata) or referential data (such as Threat intelligence feeds)
