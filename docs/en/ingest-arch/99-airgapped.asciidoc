== Air-gapped architectures


* 20. Agent, Elastic stack both is deployed in air gapped environment with no access to outside network
** Set up self managed stack and self managed EPR 
** Specify agent binary location for 8.4+, in other cases, you will need to upgrade these agents manually as described here
** If geoip enrichment is required then it's necessary to manage database updates either through a proxy, a custom endpoint, or manually.
** Additional architecture diagram to show geo-ip DBs?
