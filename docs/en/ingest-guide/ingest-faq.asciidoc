Also cover (here or in general outline): 

- https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/master/connect-to-elasticsearch.html#_add_sample_data[Sample data]
- OTel
- Beats
- Use case: GeoIP
- Airgapped
- Place for table, also adding use case + products (Exp: Logstash for multi-tenant)
- Role of LS in general content use cases

=== Questions to answer:

* Messaging for data sources that don't have an integration 
    - We're deemphasizing beats in preparation for deprecation
    - We're not quite there with OTel yet
    * How should we handle this in the near term? 
        Probably doesn't make sense to either ignore or jump them straight to Logstash

* Should we mention Fleet and Stand-alone agent? 
** If so, when, where, and how? 
* How does this relate to Ingest Architectures
* Enrichment for general content

* How to message current vs. desired state. 
    Especially Beats and OTel. 
* HOW TO MESSAGE OTel - Current state. Future state. 
* Consistent use of terminology vs. matching users' vocabulary (keywords)

==== Random

* DocsV3 - need for a sheltered space to develop new content
** Related: https://github.com/elastic/docsmobile/issues/708         
** Need a place to incubate a new doc (previews, links, etc.) 
** Refine messaging in private

=== Other resources to use, reference, reconcile

* Timeseries decision tree (needs updates)
* PM's video
** Needs an update. (We might relocate content before updating.) 
* PM's product table
** Needs an update.(We might relocate content before updating.) 
** Focuses on Agent over integrations.
** Same link text resolves to different locations. 
** Proposal: Harvest the good and possibly repurpose the table format. 
* Ingest Reference architectures
* Linkable content such as beats? Solutions ingest resources?
