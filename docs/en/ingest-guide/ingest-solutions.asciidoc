== Ingesting data for Elastic solutions

Elastic solutions--Security, Observability, and Search--are loaded with features
and functionality to help you get value and insights from your data.
{fleet-guide}[Elastic Agent] and {integrations-docs}[Elastic integrations] can help.

When you use integrations with solutions, you have an integrated experience that offers
easier implementation and decreases the time it takes to get insights and value from your data.  

[ingest-process-overview]
.High-level overview 
**** 
To use {fleet-guide}[Elastic Agent] and {integrations-docs}[Elastic integrations]
with Elastic solutions: 

1. Create an link:https://www.elastic.co/cloud[{ecloud}] deployment for your solution.
   If you don't have a {ecloud} account, you can sign up for a link:https://cloud.elastic.co/registration[free trial] get started.  
2. Add the {integrations-docs}[Elastic integration] for your data source to the deployment. 
3. link:{fleet-guide}/elastic-agent-installation.html[Install {agent}] on the systems whose data you want to collect.
****

NOTE: {serverless-docs}[Elastic serverless] makes using solutions even easier. 
Sign up for a link:{serverless-docs}/general/sign-up-trial[free trial], and check it out.

[[ingest-for-custom]]
=== Ingesting data for your own custom search solution

Elastic solutions can give you a head start for common use cases, but you are not limited.
You can still do your own thing with a custom solution designed by you.

Bring your ideas and use {es} and the {stack} to store, search, and visualize your data.
