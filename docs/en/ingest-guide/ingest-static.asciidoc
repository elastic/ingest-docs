Progressive disclosure: Start with basic use cases and work up to advanced processing

Possibly repurpose and use ingest decision tree with Beats removed?

=== Basic use cases

* {es} document APIs for documents.
* Elastic language clients for application data. 
* Elastic web crawler for web page content.
* Connectors for data from third-party sources, such as Slack, etc.
* Kibana file uploader for individual files.
* LOGSTASH??? 
** ToDO: Check out Logstash enterprisesearch-integration

* To index **documents** directly into {es}, use the {es} document APIs.
* To send **application data** directly to {es}, use an Elastic language client. 
* To index **web page content**, use the Elastic web crawler.
* To sync **data from third-party sources**, use connectors. 
* To index **single files** for testing, use the Kibana file uploader.

=== Advanced use cases: Data enrichment and transformation

Tools for enriching ingested data:

- Logstash - GEOIP enrichment. Other examples? 
** Use enterprisesearch input -> Filter(s)  -> ES or enterprisesearch output
- What else?
