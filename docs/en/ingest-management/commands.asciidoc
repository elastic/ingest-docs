[[elastic-agent-diagnostics-command]]
== elastic-agent diagnostics

Gather diagnostics information from the {agent} and component/unit it's running.
This command produces an archive that contains:

* version.txt - version information
* pre-config.yaml - pre-configuration before variable substitution
* variables.yaml - current variable contexts from providers
* computed-config.yaml - configuration after variable substitution
* components-expected.yaml - expected computed components model from the computed-config.yaml
* components-actual.yaml - actual running components model as reported by the runtime manager
* state.yaml - current state information of all running components
* Components Directory - diagnostic information from each running component:
** goroutine.txt - goroutine dump
** heap.txt - memory allocation of live objects
** allocs.txt - sampling past memory allocations
** threadcreate.txt - traces led to creation of new OS threads
** block.txt - stack traces that led to blocking on synchronization primitives
** mutex.txt - stack traces of holders of contended mutexes
** Unit Directory - If a given unit provides specific diagnostics, it will be placed here.

Note that *credentials may not be redacted* in the archive; they may appear in plain text in the configuration or policy files inside the archive.

This command is intended for debugging purposes only. The output format and structure of the archive may change between releases.

[[elastic-agent-enroll-command]]
== elastic-agent enroll

//MAINTAINERs: There's a GitHub issue open to consolidate the enroll and install
//entries here, but for now, make sure the syntax stays in sync.

Enroll the {agent} in {fleet}.

Use this command to enroll the {agent} in {fleet} without installing the
agent as a service. You will need to do this if you installed
the {agent} from a DEB or RPM package and plan to use systemd commands to
start and manage the service. This command is also useful for testing
{agent} prior to installing it.

If you've already installed {agent}, use this command to modify the settings that {agent} runs with.

TIP: To enroll an {agent} _and_ install it as a service, use the
<<elastic-agent-install-command,`install` command>> instead. Installing as a service is the most common scenario.

We recommend that you run the `enroll` (or `install`) command as the root user because some
integrations require root privileges to collect sensitive data. This command
overwrites the `elastic-agent.yml` file in the agent directory.

This command includes optional flags to set up <<fleet-server,{fleet-server}>>.

IMPORTANT: This command enrolls the {agent} in {fleet}; it does not start the
agent. To start the agent, either <<start-elastic-agent-service,start the
service>>, if one exists, or use the <<elastic-agent-run-command,`run` command>>
to start the agent from a terminal.

Comma-separated list of certificate authority hash pins used for certificate
verification.

`--certificate-authorities <string>`::
Comma-separated list of root certificates used for server verification.

`--daemon-timeout <duration>`::
Timeout waiting for {agent} daemon.

`--delay-enroll`::
Delays enrollment to occur on first start of the {agent} service. This setting
is useful when you don't want the {agent} to enroll until the next reboot or manual start of the service, for
example, when you're preparing an image that includes {agent}.

`--elastic-agent-cert`::
Certificate to use as the client certificate for the {agent}'s connections to {fleet-server}.

`--elastic-agent-cert-key`::
Private key to use as for the {agent}'s connections to {fleet-server}.

The path to the file that contains the passphrase for the mutual TLS private key that {agent} will use to connect to {fleet-server}.
The file must only contain the characters of the passphrase, no newline or extra non-printing characters.
+
This option is only used if the `--elastic-agent-cert-key` is encrypted and requires a passphrase to use.

`--enrollment-token <string>`::
Enrollment token to use to enroll {agent} into {fleet}. You can use
the same enrollment token for multiple agents.

`--fleet-server-cert <string>`::
Certificate to use for exposed {fleet-server} HTTPS endpoint.

`--fleet-server-cert-key <string>`::
Private key to use for exposed {fleet-server} HTTPS endpoint.

Path to passphrase file for decrypting {fleet-server}'s private key if an encrypted private key is used.

`--fleet-server-client-auth <string>`::
One of `none`, `optional`, or `required`. Defaults to `none`. {fleet-server}'s `client_authentication` option
for client mTLS connections. If `optional`, or `required` is specified, client certificates are verified
using CAs specified in the `--certificate-authorities` flag.

Start a {fleet-server} process when {agent} is started, and connect to the
specified {es} URL.

`--fleet-server-es-ca <string>`::
Path to certificate authority to use to communicate with {es}.

`--fleet-server-es-ca-trusted-fingerprint <string>`::
The SHA-256 fingerprint (hash) of the certificate authority used to self-sign {es} certificates.
This fingerprint will be used to verify self-signed certificates presented by {fleet-server} and any inputs started by {agent} for communication.
This flag is required when using self-signed certificates with {es}.

`--fleet-server-es-cert`::
The path to the client certificate that {fleet-server} will use when connecting to {es}.

`--fleet-server-es-cert-key`::
The path to the private key that {fleet-server} will use when connecting to {es}.

`--fleet-server-es-insecure`::
Allows fleet server to connect to {es} in the following situations:
+
--
* When connecting to an HTTP server.
* When connecting to an HTTPs server and the certificate chain cannot be
verified. The content is encrypted, but the certificate is not verified.
--
+
When this flag is used the certificate verification is disabled.

`--fleet-server-host <string>`::
{fleet-server} HTTP binding host (overrides the policy).

`--fleet-server-policy <string>`::
Used when starting a self-managed {fleet-server} to allow a specific policy to be used.

{fleet-server} HTTP binding port (overrides the policy).

`--fleet-server-service-token <string>`::
Service token to use for communication with {es}.
Mutually exclusive with `--fleet-server-service-token-path`.

`--fleet-server-service-token-path <string>`::
Service token file to use for communication with {es}.
Mutually exclusive with `--fleet-server-service-token`.

`--fleet-server-timeout <duration>`::
Timeout waiting for {fleet-server} to be ready to start enrollment.

`--force`::
Force overwrite of current configuration without prompting for confirmation.
This flag is helpful when using automation software or scripted deployments.
+
NOTE: If the {agent} is already installed on the host, using `--force` may
result in unpredictable behavior with duplicate {agent}s appearing in {fleet}.

`--header <strings>`::
Headers used in communication with elasticsearch.

`--help`::
Show help for the `enroll` command.

`--insecure`::
Allow the {agent} to connect to {fleet-server} over insecure connections. This
setting is required in the following situations:
+
--
* When connecting to an HTTP server. The API keys are sent in clear text.
* When connecting to an HTTPs server and the certificate chain cannot be
verified. The content is encrypted, but the certificate is not verified.
* When using self-signed certificates generated by {agent}.
--
+
We strongly recommend that you use a secure connection.

`--non-interactive`::
Install {agent} in a non-interactive mode. This flag is helpful when
using automation software or scripted deployments. If {agent} is
already installed on the host, the installation will terminate.

`--proxy-disabled`::
Disable proxy support including environment variables.

`--proxy-header <strings>`::
Proxy headers used with CONNECT request.

`--proxy-url <string>`::
Configures the proxy URL.

`--staging <string>`::
Configures agent to download artifacts from a staging build.

  --fleet-server-policy=a35fd520-26f5-11ec-8bd9-3374690g57b6
----

Start {agent} with {fleet-server} (running on a custom CA). This example
assumes you've generated the certificates with the following names:

* `ca.crt`: Root CA certificate
* `fleet-server.crt`: {fleet-server} certificate
* `fleet-server.key`: {fleet-server} private key
* `elasticsearch-ca.crt`: CA certificate to use to connect to {es}

[[elastic-agent-install-command]]
== elastic-agent install

Install {agent} permanently on the system and manage it by using the system's
service manager. The agent will start automatically after installation is
complete. On Linux (tar package), this command requires a system and service
manager like systemd.

IMPORTANT: If you installed {agent} from a DEB or RPM package, the `install`
command will skip the installation itself and function as an alias of the
<<elastic-agent-enroll-command,`enroll` command>> instead. Note that after
an upgrade of the {agent} using DEB or RPM the {agent} service needs to be restarted.

You must run this command as the root user (or Administrator on Windows)
to write files to the correct locations. This command overwrites the
`elastic-agent.yml` file in the agent directory.

The syntax for running this command varies by platform. For platform-specific
examples, refer to <<elastic-agent-installation>>.

<1> If no `fleet-server-cert*` flags are specified, {agent} auto-generates a
self-signed certificate with the hostname of the machine. Remote {agent}s
enrolling into a {fleet-server} with self-signed certificates must specify
the `--insecure` flag.
<2> Required when using self-signed certificate on {es} side.
<3> Required when enrolling in a {fleet-server} with custom certificates. The
URL must match the DNS name used to generate the certificate specified by
`--fleet-server-cert`.

For more information about custom certificates, refer to <<secure-connections>>.

[discrete]
=== Options

+
NOTE: If the {agent} is already installed on the host, using `--force` may
result in unpredictable behavior with duplicate {agent}s appearing in {fleet}.

`--header <strings>`::
Headers used in communication with elasticsearch.

`--help`::
Show help for the `enroll` command.

`--insecure`::
Allow the {agent} to connect to {fleet-server} over insecure connections. This
setting is required in the following situations:
+
--
* When connecting to an HTTP server. The API keys are sent in clear text.
* When connecting to an HTTPs server and the certificate chain cannot be
verified. The content is encrypted, but the certificate is not verified.
* When using self-signed certificates generated by {agent}.
--
+
We strongly recommend that you use a secure connection.

`--non-interactive`::
Install {agent} in a non-interactive mode. This flag is helpful when
using automation software or scripted deployments. If {agent} is
already installed on the host, the installation will terminate.

`--privileged`::
Run {agent} with full superuser privileges.
This is the usual, default running mode for {agent}.
The `--privileged` option allows you to switch back to running an agent with full administrative privileges when you have been running it in `unprivileged`.

A comma-separated list of tags to apply to {fleet}-managed {agent}s. You can
use these tags to filter the list of agents in {fleet}.
+
NOTE: Currently, there is no way to remove or edit existing tags. To change the
tags, you must unenroll the {agent}, then re-enroll it using new tags.

`--unprivileged`::
Run {agent} without full superuser privileges.
This option is useful in organizations that limit `root` access on Linux or macOS systems, or `admin` access on Windows systems.
For details and limitations for running {agent} in this mode, refer to {fleet-guide}/elastic-agent-unprivileged.html[Run {agent} without administrative privileges].
+
Note that changing to `unprivileged` mode is prevented if the agent is currently enrolled in a policy that includes an integration that requires administrative access, such as the {elastic-defend} integration.
+
preview:[] To run {agent} without superuser privileges as a pre-existing user or group, for instance under an Active Directory account, you can specify the user or group, and the password to use.
+
For example:
+
[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent install --unprivileged  --user="my.path\username" --password="mypassword"
----
+
[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent install --unprivileged  --group="my.path\groupname" --password="mypassword"
----

`--url <string>`::
{fleet-server} URL to use to enroll the {agent} into {fleet}.

{global-flags-link}

[discrete]
=== Examples

Install the {agent} as a service, enroll it in {fleet}, and start the
`elastic-agent` service:

[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent install \
  --url=https://cedd4e0e21e240b4s2bbbebdf1d6d52f.fleet.eu-west-1.aws.cld.elstc.co:443 \
  --enrollment-token=NEFmVllaa0JLRXhKebVKVTR5TTI6N2JaVlJpSGpScmV0ZUVnZVlRUExFQQ==
----

Install the {agent} as a service, enroll it in {fleet}, and start
a `fleet-server` process alongside the `elastic-agent` service:

[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent install --fleet-server-es=http://elasticsearch:9200 \
  --fleet-server-service-token=AbEAAdesYXN1abMvZmxlZXQtc2VldmVyL3Rva2VuLTE2MTkxMzg3MzIzMTg7dzEta0JDTmZUcGlDTjlwRmNVTjNVQQ \
  --fleet-server-policy=a35fd620-26f6-11ec-8bd9-3374690f57b6
----

Start {agent} with {fleet-server} (running on a custom CA). This example
assumes you've generated the certificates with the following names:

* `ca.crt`: Root CA certificate
* `fleet-server.crt`: {fleet-server} certificate
* `fleet-server.key`: {fleet-server} private key
* `elasticsearch-ca.crt`: CA certificate to use to connect to {es}

[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent install \
  --url=https://fleet-server:8220 \
  --fleet-server-es=https://elasticsearch:9200 \
  --fleet-server-service-token=AAEBAWVsYXm0aWMvZmxlZXQtc2XydmVyL3Rva2VuLTE2MjM4OTAztDU1OTQ6dllfVW1mYnFTVjJwTC2ZQ0EtVnVZQQ \
  --fleet-server-policy=a35fd520-26f5-11ec-8bd9-3374690g57b6 \
  --certificate-authorities=/path/to/ca.crt \
  --fleet-server-es-ca=/path/to/elasticsearch-ca.crt \
  --fleet-server-cert=/path/to/fleet-server.crt \
  --fleet-server-cert-key=/path/to/fleet-server.key \
  --fleet-server-port=8220
----

Then install another {agent} and enroll it into the {fleet-server} started in
the previous example:

[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent install --url=https://fleet-server:8220 \
  --enrollment-token=NEFmVllaa0JLRXhKebVKVTR5TTI6N2JaVlJpSGpScmV0ZUVnZVlRUExFQQ== \

[discrete]
=== Options

`--output <string>`::
Output the status information in either `human` (the default),
`full`, `json`, or `yaml`.  `human` returns limited information
when {agent} is in the `HEALTHY` state. If any components or units are
not in `HEALTHY` state, then full details are displayed for that
component or unit.  `full`, `json` and `yaml` always return the
full status information.  Components map to individual processes
running underneath {agent}, for example {filebeat} or {endpoint-sec}.
Units map to discrete configuration units within that process, for
example {filebeat} inputs or {metricbeat} modules.

When the output is `json` or `yaml`, status codes are returned as
numerical values.  The status codes can be mapped using the following
table:

+
