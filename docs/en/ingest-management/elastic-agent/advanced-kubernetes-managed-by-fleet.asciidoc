= Advanced {agent} configuration managed by {fleet}

For basic {agent} managed by {fleet} scenarios follow the steps on <<running-on-kubernetes-managed-by-fleet>> page.

On managed {agent} installations could be useful to provide the ability to configure more advanced options like the configuration of providers during the startup. Refer to <<providers>> for more details.

Following steps demonstrate above scenario:

== Step 1: Download the {agent} manifest

It is advisable to follow the steps of <<install-fleet-managed-elastic-agent>> with Kubernetes Integration installed in your policy and download the {agent} manifest from Kibana UI

Notes:: 
Sample manifests can also be found https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/blob/main/deploy/kubernetes/elastic-agent-managed-kubernetes.yaml[here]

== Step 2: Create a new configmap

[source,yaml]
. Create a new configmap
------------------------------------------------
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: agent-node-datastreams
  namespace: kube-system
  labels:
    k8s-app: elastic-agent
data:
  agent.yml: |-
    providers.kubernetes_leaderelection.enabled: false
    fleet.enabled: true
    fleet.access_token: "<FLEET_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN>"
---
------------------------------------------------

Notes:: 
1. In the above example the disablement of `kubernetes_leaderelection` provider is demonstrated. Same procedure can be followed for alternative scenarios.
2. Find more information for https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-enrollment-tokens.html[Enrollment Tokens].

== Step 3: Configure Daemonset

Inside the downloaded manifest, update Daemonset resource part:

[source,yaml]
.Update entrypoint 
------------------------------------------------
containers:
  - name: elastic-agent
    image: docker.elastic.co/beats/elastic-agent: <ImageVersion>     
    args: ["-c", "/etc/elastic-agent/agent.yml", "-e"]
------------------------------------------------

Notes:: 
The <ImageVersion> is just a placeholder for the elastic-agent image version that will you will download in your manifest: eg. `image: docker.elastic.co/beats/elastic-agent: 8.11.0`
Important thing is to update your manifest with args details 

[source,yaml]
.Add extra Volume Mount 
------------------------------------------------
volumeMounts:
  - name: datastreams
    mountPath: /etc/elastic-agent/agent.yml
    readOnly: true
    subPath: agent.yml
------------------------------------------------

[source,yaml]
.Add new Volume 
------------------------------------------------
volumes:
  - name: datastreams
    configMap:
      defaultMode: 0640
      name: agent-node-datastreams
------------------------------------------------

== Important Note

By default the manifests for {agent} managed by {fleet} have `hostNetwork:true`. In order to support multiple installations of {agent}s in the same node you should set `hostNetwork:false`. See relevant https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/tree/main/docs/manifests/hostnetwork[example] as described in https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/blob/main/docs/elastic-agent-ksm-sharding.md[{agent} Manifests in order to support Kube-State-Metrics Sharding]
