The {agent} installation includes an `elastic-agent.reference.yml` file that
describes all the settings available in a standalone configuration.

To ensure that you're accessing the latest version, refer to the original link:https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/blob/main/elastic-agent.reference.yml[`elastic-agent.reference.yml` file] in the `elastic/elastic-agent` repository.
A copy is included here for your convenience.

Each section of the file and available settings are also described in <<structure-config-file,Structure of a config file>>.
