[[elastic-agent-unprivileged]]
= Run {agent} without administrative privileges

Beginning with {stack} version 8.15, {agent} is no longer required to be run by a user with superuser privileges. You can now run agents in an `unprivileged` mode that does not require `root` access on Linux or macOS, or `admin` access on Windows. Being able to run agents without full administrative privileges is often a requirement in organizations where this kind of access is often very limited.

In general, agents running without full administrative privileges will perform and behave exactly as those run by a superuser. There are certain integrations and datastreams that are not available, however. If an integration requires root access, this is <<unprivileged-integrations,indicated on the integration main page>>.

// Add mention of the System integration data streams.

You can also <<unprivileged-change-mode,change the privilege mode>> of an {agent} after it has been installed.

Refer to <<unprivileged-command-behaviors>> and <<unprivileged-running>> for the requirements and steps associated with running an agent without full `root` or `admin` superuser privileges.

[[unprivileged-running]]
== Run {agent} in `unprivileged` mode

To run {agent} without administrative privileges you use exactly the same commands that you use for {agent} otherwise, with one exception. When you run the <<elastic-agent-install-command,`elastic-agent install`>> command, add the `--unprivileged` flag. For example:

[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent install \
  --url=https://cedd4e0e21e240b4s2bbbebdf1d6d52f.fleet.eu-west-1.aws.cld.elstc.co:443 \
  --enrollment-token=NEFmVllaa0JLRXhKebVKVTR5TTI6N2JaVlJpSGpScmV0ZUVnZVlRUExFQQ== \
  --unprivileged
----

[IMPORTANT] 
====
Note the following current restrictions for running {agent} in `unprivileged` mode:

* On Linux systems, after {agent} has been installed with the `--unprivileged` flag, all {agent} commands can be run without being the root user.
** The `sudo` option is still required for the `elastic-agent install` command.
Only `root` can install new services.
The installed service will not run as the root user.
* Using `sudo` without specifying an alternate non-root user with `sudo -u` in a command may result in <<agent-sudo-error,an error>> due to the agent not having the required privileges.
* Using `sudo -u elastic-agent-user` will run commands as the user running the {agent} service and will always work.
* For files that allow users in the `elastic-agent` group access, using an alternate user that has been added to that group will also work.
There are still some commands that are only accessible to the `elastic-agent-user` that runs the service.
** For example, `elastic-agent inspect` requires you to prefix the command with `sudo -u elastic-agent-user`.

[[unprivileged-command-behaviors]]
== Agent and dashboard behaviors in unprivileged mode

In addition to the <<unprivileged-integrations,integrations that are not available>> when {agent} is run in unpriviledged mode, certain data streams are also not available. The following tables show, for different operating systems, the impact when the agent does not have full administrative privileges. In most cases the limitations can be mediated by granting permissions for a user or group to the files indicated.

[[unprivileged-integrations]]
== Using Elastic integrations

// Add mention of the System integration data streams.

Most Elastic integrations support running {agent} in unprivileged mode. For the exceptions, any integration that requires {agent} to have root privileges has the requirement indicated at the top of the integration page in {kib}:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/integration-root-requirement.png[Elastic Defend integration page showing root requirement]

As well, a warning is displayed in {kib} if you try to add an integration that requires root privileges to an {agent} policy that has agents enrolled in unprivileged mode.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/unprivileged-agent-warning.png[Warning indicating that root privileged agent is required for an integration]

Examples of integrations that require {agent} to have administrative privileges are:

[[unprivileged-view-mode]]
== Viewing an {agent} privilege mode

The **Agent details** page shows you the privilege mode for any running {agent}.

To view the status of an {agent}:

. In {fleet}, open the **Agents** tab.
. Select an agent and click **View agent** in the actions menu.
. The **Agent details** tab shows whether the agent is running in `privileged` or `unprivileged` mode.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/agent-privilege-mode.png[Agent details tab showing the agent is running as non-root]

As well, for any {agent} policy you can view the number of agents that are currently running in privileged or unprivileged mode:

. In {fleet}, open the **Agent policies** tab.

. Click the agent policy to view the policy details.

The number of agents enrolled with the policy is shown. Hover over the link to view the number of privileged and unpriviled agents.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/privileged-and-unprivileged-agents.png[Agent policy tab showing 1 unprivileged agent and 0 privileged enrolled agents]

In the event that the {agent} policy has integrations installed that require root privileges, but there are agents running without root privileges, this is shown in the tooltip.

[discrete]
[[unprivileged-change-mode]]
== Changing an {agent}'s privilege mode

For any installed {agent} you can change the mode that it's running in by running the `privileged` or `unprivileged` subcommand.

Change mode from privileged to unprivileged:

[source,shell]
----
sudo elastic-agent unprivileged
----

Note that changing to `unprivileged` mode is prevented if the agent is currently enrolled in a policy that includes an integration that requires administrative access, such as the {elastic-defend} integration.

Change mode from unprivileged to privileged:

[source,shell]
----
sudo elastic-agent privileged
----

When an agent is running in `unprivileged` mode, if it doesn't have the right level of privilege to read a data source, you can also adjust the agent's privileges by adding `elastic-agent-user` to the user group that has privileges to read the data source.

As background, when you run {agent} in `unprivileged` mode, one user and one group are created on the host. The same names are used for all operating systems:

* `elastic-agent-user`: The user that is created and that the {agent} service runs as.
* `elastic-agent`: The group that is created. Any user in this group has access to control and communicate over the control protocol to the {agent} daemon.

For example:

. When you install {agent} with the `--unprivileged` setting, the `elastic-agent-user` user and the `elastic-agent` group are created automatically.
. If you then want your user `myuser` to be able to run an {agent} command such as `elastic-agent status`, add the `myuser` user to the `elastic-agent` group.
. Then, once added to the group, the `elastic-agent status` command will work. Prior to that, the user `myuser` running the command will result in a permission error that indicates a problem communicating with the control socket.

[[unprivileged-preexisting-user]]
== Using `unprivileged` mode with a pre-existing user and group

preview::[]

In certain cases you may want to install {agent} in `unprivileged` mode, with the agent running as a pre-existing user or as part of a pre-existing group.
For example, on a Windows system you may have a service account in Active Directory and you'd like {agent} to run under that account.

To install {agent} in `unprivileged` mode as a specific user, add the `--user` and `--password` parameters to the install command:

[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent install --unprivileged  --user="my.path\username" --password="mypassword"
----

To install {agent} in `unprivileged` mode as part of a specific group, add the `--group` and `--password` parameters to the install command:

[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent install --unprivileged  --group="my.path\groupname" --password="mypassword"
----

Alternatively, if you have {agent} already installed with administrative privileges, you can change the agent to use `unprivileged` mode and to run as a specific user or in a specific group.
For example:

[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent unprivileged --user="my.path\username" --password="mypassword"
----

[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent unprivileged --group="my.path\groupname" --password="mypassword"
----
