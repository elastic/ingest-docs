[[elastic-agent-unprivileged]]
= Run {agent} without administrative privileges

Beginning with {stack} version 8.15, {agent} is no longer required to be run by a user with superuser privileges. You can now run agents in an `unprivileged` mode that does not require `root` access on Linux or macOS, or `admin` access on Windows. Being able to run agents without full administrative privileges is often a requirement in organizations where this kind of access is often very limited.

In general, agents running without full administrative privileges will perform and behave exactly as those run by a superuser. There are certain integrations and datastreams that are not available, however. If an integration requires root access, this is <<unprivileged-integrations,indicated on the integration main page>>.

// Add mention of the System integration data streams.

You can also <<unprivileged-change-mode,change the privilege mode>> of an {agent} after it has been installed.

Refer to <<unprivileged-command-behaviors>> and <<unprivileged-running>> for the requirements and steps associated with running an agent without full `root` or `admin` superuser privileges.

[[unprivileged-running]]
== Run {agent} in `unprivileged` mode

To run {agent} without administrative privileges you use exactly the same commands that you use for {agent} otherwise, with one exception. When you run the <<elastic-agent-install-command,`elastic-agent install`>> command, add the `--unprivileged` flag. For example:

[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent install \
  --url=https://cedd4e0e21e240b4s2bbbebdf1d6d52f.fleet.eu-west-1.aws.cld.elstc.co:443 \
  --enrollment-token=NEFmVllaa0JLRXhKebVKVTR5TTI6N2JaVlJpSGpScmV0ZUVnZVlRUExFQQ== \
  --unprivileged
----

IMPORTANT: On Linux systems, once {agent} has been installed with the `--unprivileged` flag, all {agent} commands that you run should not be prefixed with `sudo`.
Including `sudo` in a command may result in <<agent-sudo-error,an error>> due to the agent not having the required privileges.

[[unprivileged-command-behaviors]]
== Agent and dashboard behaviors in unprivileged mode

In addition to the <<unprivileged-integrations,integrations that are not available>> when {agent} is run in unpriviledged mode, certain data streams are also not available. The following tables show, for different operating systems, the impact when the agent does not have full administrative privileges. In most cases the limitations can be mediated by granting permissions for a user or group to the files indicated.

|Add the `elastic-agent-user` user to the `Event Log Users` group and update the permissions for the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\PartMgr` registry to fix the missing visualizations.

Note that the `elastic-agent-user` user may still not have access to all processes, so the lists in the `Top processes by CPU usage` and `Top processes by memory usage` visualizations may be incomplete. 

|Run {agent} with the System integration
|On the `[Metrics System] Host overview` dashboard, the `Disk usage` visualizations are missing data. 
|This occurs because direct access to the disk or a volume is restricted and not available to users without administrative privileges.

[[unprivileged-integrations]]
== Using Elastic integrations

// Add mention of the System integration data streams.

Most Elastic integrations support running {agent} in unprivileged mode. For the exceptions, any integration that requires {agent} to have root privileges has the requirement indicated at the top of the integration page in {kib}:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/integration-root-requirement.png[Elastic Defend integration page showing root requirement]

As well, a warning is displayed in {kib} if you try to add an integration that requires root privileges to an {agent} policy that has agents enrolled in unprivileged mode.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/unprivileged-agent-warning.png[Warning indicating that root privileged agent is required for an integration]

Examples of integrations that require {agent} to have administrative privileges are:

[[unprivileged-view-mode]]
== Viewing an {agent} privilege mode

The **Agent details** page shows you the privilege mode for any running {agent}.

To view the status of an {agent}:

. In {fleet}, open the **Agents** tab.
. Select an agent and click **View agent** in the actions menu.
. The **Agent details** tab shows whether the agent is running in `privileged` or `unprivileged` mode.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/agent-privilege-mode.png[Agent details tab showing the agent is running as non-root]

As well, for any {agent} policy you can view the number of agents that are currently running in privileged or unprivileged mode:

. In {fleet}, open the **Agent policies** tab.

. Click the agent policy to view the policy details.

The number of agents enrolled with the policy is shown. Hover over the link to view the number of privileged and unpriviled agents.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/privileged-and-unprivileged-agents.png[Agent policy tab showing 1 unprivileged agent and 0 privileged enrolled agents]

In the event that the {agent} policy has integrations installed that require root privileges, but there are agents running without root privileges, this is shown in the tooltip.

[[unprivileged-change-mode]]
== Changing an {agent}'s privilege mode

For any installed {agent} you can change the mode that it's running in by running the `privileged` or `unprivileged` subcommand.

Change mode from privileged to unprivileged:

[source,shell]
----
sudo elastic-agent unprivileged
----

Note that this change requires {agent} to be re-enrolled, which triggers a loss of state and any associated issues, including the possibility of duplicated ingested data.

Change mode from unprivileged to privileged:

[source,shell]
----
sudo elastic-agent privileged
----

When an agent is running in `unprivileged` mode, if it doesn't have the right level of privilege to read a data source, you can also adjust the agent's privileges by adding `elastic-agent-user` to the user group that has privileges to read the data source.

As background, when you run {agent} in `unprivileged` mode, one user and one group are created on the host. The same names are used for all operating systems:

* `elastic-agent-user`: The user that is created and that the {agent} service runs as.
* `elastic-agent`: The group that is created. Any user in this group has access to control and communicate over the control protocol to the {agent} daemon.

For example:

. When you install {agent} with the `--unprivileged` setting, the `elastic-agent-user` user and the `elastic-agent` group are created automatically.
. If you then want your user `myuser` to be able to run an {agent} command such as `elastic-agent status`, add the `myuser` user to the `elastic-agent` group.
. Then, once added to the group, the `elastic-agent status` command will work. Prior to that, the user `myuser` running the command will result in a permission error that indicates a problem communicating with the control socket.
