= Example: Install {fleet}-managed {agent} on {k8s} using Helm

preview::[]

This example demonstrates how to install {fleet}-managed {agent} on a {k8s} system using a Helm chart, gather {k8s} metrics and send them to an {es} cluster in {ecloud}, and then view visualizations of those metrics in {kib}.

For an overview of the {agent} Helm chart and its benefits, refer to <<install-on-kubernetes-using-helm>>.

This guide takes you through these steps:

=== Prerequisites

To get started, you need:

* A local install of the link:https://helm.sh/[Helm] {k8s} package manager.
* An link:{ess-trial}[{ecloud}] hosted {es} cluster on version 8.16 or higher.
* An active {k8s} cluster.
* A local clone of the link:https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/tree/8.16[elastic/elastic-agent] GitHub repository. Make sure to use the `8.16` branch to ensure that {agent} has full compatibility with the Helm chart.

=== Install {agent}

. Open your {ecloud} deployment, and from the navigation menu select **Fleet**.
. From the **Agents** tab, select **Add agent**.
. In the **Add agent** UI, specify a policy name and select **Create policy**. Leave the **Collect system logs and metrics** option selected.
. Scroll down in the **Add agent** flyout to the **Install Elastic Agent on your host** section.
. Select the **Linux TAR** tab and copy the values for `url` and `enrollment-token`. You'll use these when you run the `helm install` command.
. Open a terminal shell and change into a directory in your local clone of the `elastic-agent` repo.
. Copy this command.
+
[source,sh]
----
helm install demo ./deploy/helm/elastic-agent \
--set agent.fleet.enabled=true \
--set agent.fleet.url=<Fleet-URL> \
--set agent.fleet.token=<Fleet-token> \
--set agent.fleet.preset=perNode
----
+
Note that the command has these properties:

* `helm install` runs the Helm CLI install tool.
* `demo` gives a name to the installed chart. You can choose any name.
* `./deploy/helm/elastic-agent` is a local path to the Helm chart to install (in time it's planned to have a public URL for the chart).
* `--set agent.fleet.enabled=true` enables {fleet}-managed {agent}. The CLI parameter overrides the default `false` value for `agent.fleet.enabled` in the {agent} link:https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/blob/main/deploy/helm/elastic-agent/values.yaml[values.yaml] file.
* `--set agent.fleet.url=<Fleet-URL>` sets the address where {agent} will connect to {fleet} in your {ecloud} deployment, over port 443 (again, overriding the value set by default in the {agent} link:https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/blob/main/deploy/helm/elastic-agent/values.yaml[values.yaml] file).
* `--set agent.fleet.token=<Fleet-token>` sets the enrollment token that {agent} uses to authenticate with {fleet}.
* `--set agent.fleet.preset=perNode` enables {k8s} metrics on `per node` basis. You can alternatively set cluster wide metrics (`clusterWide`) or kube-state-metrics (`ksmSharded`).

TIP: For a full list of all available YAML settings and descriptions, refer to the link:https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/tree/main/deploy/helm/elastic-agent[{agent} Helm Chart Readme].
--
. Update the command to replace:
.. `<Fleet-URL>` with the URL that you copied earlier.
.. `<Fleet-token>` with the enrollment token that you copied earlier.
+
After your updates, the command should look something like this:
+
[source,sh]
----
helm install demo ./deploy/helm/elastic-agent \
--set agent.fleet.enabled=true \
--set agent.fleet.url=https://256575858845283fxxxxxxxd5265d2b4.fleet.us-central1.gcp.foundit.no:443 \
--set agent.fleet.token=eSVvFDUvSUNPFldFdhhZNFwvS5xxxxxxxxxxxxFEWB1eFF1YedUQ1NWFXwr== \
--set agent.fleet.preset=perNode
----

. Run the command.
+
The command output should confirm that {agent} has been installed:
+
[source,sh]
----
...
Installed agent:
  - perNode [daemonset - managed mode]
...
----

. Run the `kubectl get pods -n default` command to confirm that the {agent} pod is running:
+
[source,sh]
----
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
agent-pernode-demo-86mst   1/1     Running   0          12s
----

. In the **Add agent** flyout, wait a minute or so for confirmation that {agent} has successfully enrolled with {fleet} and that data is flowing:
+

. In {fleet}, open the **Agents** tab and see that an **Agent-pernode-demo-#####** agent is running.

. Select the agent to view its details.

. On the **Agent details** tab, on the **Integrations** pane, expand `system-1` to confirm that logs and metrics are incoming. You can click either the `Logs` or `Metrics` link to view details.

[[agent-fleet-managed-helm-example-install-integration]]
=== Install the Kubernetes integration

Now that you've {agent} and data is flowing, you can set up the {k8s} integration.

. In your {ecloud} deployment, from the {kib} menu open the **Integrations** page.
. Run a search for `Kubernetes` and then select the {k8s} integration card.
. On the {k8s} integration page, click **Add Kubernetes** to add the integration to your {agent} policy.
. Scroll to the bottom of **Add Kubernetes integration** page. Under **Where to add this integration?** select the **Existing hosts** tab. On the **Agent policies** menu, select the agent policy that you created previously in the <<agent-fleet-managed-helm-example-install-agent>> steps.
+
You can leave all of the other integration settings at their default values.
. Click **Save and continue**. When prompted, select to **Add Elastic Agent later** since you've already added it using Helm.
. On the {k8s} integration page, open the **Assets** tab and select the **[Metrics Kubernetes] Pods** dashboard.
+
On the dashboard, you can view the status of your {k8s} pods, including metrics on memory usage, CPU usage, and network throughput.
+

You've successfully installed {agent} using Helm, and your {k8s} metrics data is available for viewing in {kib}.

[[agent-fleet-managed-helm-example-tidy-up]]
=== Tidy up

After you've run through this example, run the `helm uninstall` command to uninstall {agent}.

[source,sh]
----
helm uninstall demo
----

The uninstall should be confirmed as shown:

[source,sh]
----
release "demo" uninstalled
----
