== Linux and Unix requirements

Currently, on Linux and Unix systems {agent} needs to run as a super user with `sudo` privileges. To create a new user with `sudo` privileges:

. Create a user for your {agent}.
+
[source,sh]
----
useradd elastic
----

. Add the new user to `sudo` group.
+
[source,sh]
----
usermod -aG sudo elastic
----

. Proceed with the instructions to <<install-fleet-managed-elastic-agent>> or <<install-standalone-elastic-agent>>.

As well, {agent} components (Beats) each use a unique account with specific controlled `sudo` privileges, as shown in the following table.
