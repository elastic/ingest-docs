= Install {agent}s

[IMPORTANT]
.Restrictions
====
Note the following restrictions when installing {agent} on your system:

* You can install only a single {agent} per host. Due to the fact that the {agent} may read data sources that are only accessible by a superuser, {agent} will therefore also need to be executed with superuser permissions.
* You might need to log in as a root user (or Administrator on Windows) to
run the commands described here. After the {agent} service is installed and running,
make sure you run these commands without prepending them with `./` to avoid
invoking the wrong binary.
* Running {agent} commands using the Windows PowerShell ISE is not supported.
* See also the <<elastic-agent-installation-resource-requirements,resource requirements>> described on this page.
====

You have a few options for installing and managing an {agent}:

* **Install a {fleet}-managed {agent} (recommended)**
+
With this approach, you install {agent} and use {fleet} in {kib} to define,
configure, and manage your agents in a central location.
+
We recommend using {fleet} management because it makes the management and
upgrade of your agents considerably easier.
+
Refer to <<install-fleet-managed-elastic-agent>>.

* **Install {agent} in standalone mode (advanced users)**
+
With this approach, you install {agent} and manually configure the agent locally
on the system where itâ€™s installed. You are responsible for managing and
upgrading the agents. This approach is reserved for advanced users only.
+
Refer to <<install-standalone-elastic-agent>>.

*  **Install {agent} in a containerized environment**
+
You can run {agent} inside of a container -- either with {fleet-server} or
standalone. Docker images for all versions of {agent} are available from the
Elastic Docker registry, and we provide deployment manifests for running on
Kubernetes.

[IMPORTANT]
.Restrictions in {serverless-short}
====
If you are using {agent} with link:{serverless-docs}[{serverless-full}], note these differences from use with {ess} and self-managed {es}:

* The number of {agents} that may be connected to an {serverless-full} project is limited to 10 thousand.
* The minimum supported version of {agent} supported for use with {serverless-full} is 8.11.0.

[[elastic-agent-installation-resource-requirements]]
== Resource requirements

The {agent} resources consumption is influenced by the number of integration and the environment its been running on.

Using our lab environment as an example, we can observe the following resource consumption:

// lint ignore mem
[discrete]
=== CPU and RSS memory size

// lint ignore 2 vCPU 8.0 GiB
We tested using an AWS `m7i.large` instance type with 2 vCPUs, 8.0 GB of memory, and up to 12.5 Gbps of bandwidth. The tests ingested a single log file using both the <<output-elasticsearch-performance-tuning-settings,throughput and scale preset>> with self monitoring enabled.
These tests are representative of use cases that attempt to ingest data as fast as possible. This does not represent the resource overhead when using {integrations-docs}/endpoint[{elastic-defend}].
[options,header]
|===
| **Resource** | **Throughput** | **Scale**
| **CPU*** | ~67% total | ~20%
| **RSS memory size*** | ~280 MB | ~220 MB
| **Write network throughput** | ~3.5 MB/s | 480 KB/s
|===

^*^ including all monitoring processes

Adding integrations will increase the memory used by the agent and its processes.

[discrete]
=== Size on disk

The disk requirements for {agent} vary by operating system and {stack} version. With version 8.14 we have significantly reduced the size of the {agent} binary. Further reductions are planned to be made in future releases.

[options,header]
|===
|Operating system |8.13 |8.14

| **Linux** | 1800 MB | 1018 MB
| **macOS** | 1100 MB | 619 MB
| **Windows** | 891 MB | 504 MB
|===

During upgrades, double the disk space is required to store the new {agent} binary. After the upgrade completes, the original {agent} is removed from disk to free up the space.
