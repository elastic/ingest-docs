= Run {agent} as an OTel Collector

preview::[]

The link:https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/[OpenTelemetry Collector] is a vendor-neutral way to receive, process, and export telemetry data. {agent} includes an embedded OTel Collector, enabling you to instrument your applications and infrastructure once, and send data to multiple vendors and backends. 

When you run {agent} in `otel` mode it supports the standard OTel Collector configuration format that defines a set of receivers, processors, exporters, and connectors. Logs, metrics, and traces can be ingested using OpenTelemetry data formats.

For a full overview and steps to configure {agent} in `otel` mode, including a guided onboarding, refer to the link:https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry/tree/main[Elastic Distributions for OpenTelemetry] repository in GitHub. You can also check the <<elastic-agent-otel-command,`elastic-agent otel` command>> in the {fleet} and {agent} Command reference.
