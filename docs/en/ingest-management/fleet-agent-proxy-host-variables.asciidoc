[[host-proxy-env-vars]]
= Proxy Server connectivity using default host variables

Set environment variables on the host to configure default proxy settings.
The {agent} uses host environment settings by default if no proxy settings are
specified elsewhere. You can override host proxy settings later when you
configure the {agent} and {fleet} settings. The following environment variables
are available on the host:

|===
|Variable |Description

|`HTTP_PROXY`
|URL of the proxy server for HTTP traffic. 

|`HTTPS_PROXY`
|URL of the proxy server for HTTPS traffic.

|`NO_PROXY`
|IP addresses or domain names that should not use the proxy. Supports patterns.
|===

The proxy URL can be a complete URL or `host[:port]`, in which case the `http`
scheme is assumed. An error is returned if the value is a different form.

[[where-to-set-proxy-env-vars]]
== Where to set proxy environment variables

The location where you set these environment variables is platform-specific and
based on the system manager you're using. Here are some examples to get you
started. For more information about setting environment variables, refer to the
documentation for your operating system.

// lint ignore agent
* For Windows services, set environment variables for the service in
the Windows registry.
+
This PowerShell command sets the
`HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Elastic Agent\Environment` registry
key, then restarts {agent}:
+
[source,yaml]
----
$environment = [string[]]@(
  "HTTPS_PROXY=https://proxy-hostname:proxy-port",
  "HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy-hostname:proxy-port"
  )

Set-ItemProperty "HKLM:SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Elastic Agent" -Name Environment -Value $environment

Restart-Service "Elastic Agent"
----

* For Linux services, the location depends on the distribution you're using.
For example, you can set environment variables in:

** `/etc/systemd/system/elastic-agent.service` for systems that use `systemd` to
manage the service. To edit the file, run:
+
[source,shell]
----
sudo systemctl edit --full elastic-agent.service
----
+
Then add the environment variables under `[Service]`
+
[source,shell]
----
[Service]

Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=https://my.proxy:8443"
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://my.proxy:8080"
----

** `/etc/sysconfig/elastic-agent` for Red Hat-like distributions that don't use
`systemd`.

** `/etc/default/elastic-agent` for Debian and Ubuntu distributions that don't
use `systemd`.
+
For example:
+
[source,shell]
----
HTTPS_PROXY=https://my.proxy:8443
HTTP_PROXY=http://my.proxy:8080
----

After adding environment variables, restart the service.

NOTE: If you use a proxy server to download new agent versions from `artifacts.elastic.co` for upgrading, configure <<fleet-agent-binary-download-settings>>.
