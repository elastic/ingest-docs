[[fleet-agent-proxy-standalone]]
= Standalone {agent} connectivity using a proxy server

Proxy settings in the {agent} policy override proxy settings specified by
environment variables. This means you can specify proxy settings for {agent}
that are different from host or system-level environment settings. 

The following proxy settings are valid in the agent policy:

|===
|Setting | Description

|`proxy_url`
| (string) URL of the proxy server. If set, the configured URL is used as a
proxy for all connection attempts by the component. The value may be either a
complete URL or a `host[:port]`, in which case the `http` scheme is assumed. If
a value is not specified through the configuration, then proxy environment
variables are used. The URL accepts optional `username` and `password` settings
for authenticating with the proxy. For example:
`http://<username>:<password>@<proxy host>/`.

|`proxy_headers`
| (string) Additional headers to send to the proxy during CONNECT requests. You
can use this setting to pass keys/tokens required for authenticating with the
proxy.

|`proxy_disable`
| (boolean) If set to `true`, all proxy settings, including the `HTTP_PROXY` and
`HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables, are ignored.

=== Set the proxy for communicating with {es}

//To set the proxy for communicating with {es}, specify proxy settings under
//`outputs` in the agent policy. The procedure for doing this depends on
//whether you're running {fleet}-managed or standalone agents:

For standalone agents, to set the proxy for communicating with {es}, specify proxy settings in the `elastic-agent.yml` file. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
outputs:
  default:
    api_key: API-KEY
    hosts:
    - https://10.0.1.2:9200
    proxy_url: http://10.0.1.7:3128
    type: elasticsearch
