= When to configure proxy settings

Configure proxy settings for {agent} when it must connect through a proxy server
to:

* Download artifacts from `artifacts.elastic.co` for subprocesses or binary
upgrades (use <<fleet-agent-binary-download-settings>>)
* Send data to {es}
* Retrieve agent policies from {fleet-server}
* Retrieve agent policies from {es} (only needed for agents running {fleet-server})

If {fleet} is unable to access the {package-registry} because {kib} is
behind a proxy server, you may also need to set the registry proxy URL
in the {kib} configuration.
