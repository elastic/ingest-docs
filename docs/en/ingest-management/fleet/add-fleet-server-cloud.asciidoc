[[add-fleet-server-cloud]]
= Deploy on {ecloud}

To use {fleet} for central management, a <<fleet-server,{fleet-server}>> must
be running and accessible to your hosts.

{fleet-server} can be provisioned and hosted on {ecloud}. When the Cloud deployment is created,
a highly available set of {fleet-server}s is provisioned automatically.

This approach might be right for you if you want to reduce on-prem compute resources
and you'd like Elastic to take care of provisioning and life cycle management of
your deployment.

With this approach, multiple {fleet-server}s are automatically provisioned to satisfy
the chosen instance size (instance sizes are modified to satisfy the scale requirement).
You can also choose the resources allocated to each {fleet-server} and whether you want
each {fleet-server} to be deployed in multiple availability zones.
If you choose multiple availability zones to address your fault-tolerance
requirements, those instances are also utilized to balance the load.

This approach might _not_ be right for you if you have restrictions on connectivity
to the internet.

[[fleet-server-compatibility]]
= Compatibility and prerequisites

{fleet-server} is compatible with the following Elastic products:

* {stack} 7.13 or later.
** For version compatibility, {es} must be at the same or a later version than {fleet-server}, and {fleet-server} needs to be at the same or a later version than {agent} (not including patch releases).
** {kib} should be on the same minor version as {es}.

* {ece} 2.10 or later
+
--
** Requires additional wildcard domains and certificates (which normally only
cover `*.cname`, not `*.*.cname`). This enables us to provide the URL for
{fleet-server} of `https://.fleet.`.
** The deployment template must contain an {integrations-server} node.
--
+
For more information about hosting {fleet-server} on {ece}, refer to
{ece-ref}/ece-manage-integrations-server.html[Manage your {integrations-server}].

NOTE: The TLS certificates used to secure connections between {agent} and
{fleet-server} are managed by {ecloud}. You do not need to create a private key
or generate certificates.

When {es} or {fleet-server} are deployed, components communicate over well-defined, pre-allocated ports.
You may need to allow access to these ports. See the following table for default port assignments:

|===
| Component communication | Default port

| Elastic Agent → {fleet-server} | 443
| Elastic Agent → {es} | 443
| Elastic Agent → Logstash | 5044
| Elastic Agent → {kib} ({fleet}) | 443
| {fleet-server} → {kib} ({fleet}) | 443
| {fleet-server} → {es} | 443
|===

NOTE: If you do not specify the port for {es} as 443, the {agent} defaults to 9200.

[[add-fleet-server-cloud-set-up]]
= Setup

To confirm that an {integrations-server} is available in your deployment:

. Open {fleet}.
. On the **Agent policies** tab, look for the **{ecloud} agent policy**. This policy is
managed by {ecloud}, and contains a {fleet-server} integration and an Elastic
APM integration. You cannot modify the policy. Confirm that the agent status is
**Healthy**.

[TIP]
====
Don't see the agent? Make sure your deployment includes an
{integrations-server} instance. This instance is required to use {fleet}.

Now you're ready to add {agent}s to your host systems. To learn how, see
<<install-fleet-managed-elastic-agent>>.
