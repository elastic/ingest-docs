= Setting outputs per integration

If you have an `Enterprise` link:https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[{stack} subscription], you can configure {agent} data to be sent to different outputs for different integration policies. Integration-level outputs are very useful for certain scenarios. For example:

* You can may want to send security logs monitored by an {agent} to one {ls} output, while informational logs are sent to a another {ls} output.
* If you operate multiple {beats} on a system and want to migrate these to {agent}, integration-level outputs enable you to maintain the distinct outputs that are currently used by each Beat.
