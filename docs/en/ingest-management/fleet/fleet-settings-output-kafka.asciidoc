== General settings

[cols="2*<a"]
|===
|
[id="kafka-output-version"]
**Kafka version**

| The Kafka protocol version that {agent} will request when connecting. 
Defaults to `1.0.0`.
Currently Kafka versions from `0.8.2.0` to `2.6.0` are supported, however the latest 
Kafka version (`3.x.x`) is expected to be compatible when version `2.6.0` is selected.

// =============================================================================

|
[id="kafka-output-hosts"]
**Hosts**

| The addresses your {agent}s will use to connect to one or more Kafka brokers. 
Use the format `host:port` (without any protocol `http://`). Click **Add row** to specify additional addresses.

**Examples:**

* `localhost:9092`
* `mykafkahost:9092`

Refer to the <<fleet-server,{fleet-server}>> documentation for default ports and other configuration details.

|===

[discrete]
== Authentication settings

Select the mechanism that {agent} uses to authenticate with Kafka.

[cols="2*<a"]
|===
|
[id="kafka-output-authentication-none"]
**None**

| No authentication is used between {agent} and Kafka. This is the default option. In production, it's recommended to have an authentication method selected.

Plaintext::
Set this option for traffic between {agent} and Kafka to be sent as plaintext, without any transport layer security.
+
This is the default option when no authentication is set.

Encryption::
Set this option for traffic between {agent} and Kafka to use transport layer security.
+
When **Encryption** is selected, the **Server SSL certificate authorities** and **Verification mode** mode options become available.

|
[id="kafka-output-authentication-basic"]
**Username / Password**

| Connect to Kafka with a username and password.

Provide your username and password, and select a SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) mechanism for your login credentials.

When SCRAM is enabled, {agent} uses the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_Challenge_Response_Authentication_Mechanism[SCRAM] mechanism to authenticate the user credential. SCRAM is based on the IETF RFC5802 standard which describes a challenge-response mechanism for authenticating users.

* Plain - SCRAM is not used to authenticate
* SCRAM-SHA-256 - uses the SHA-256 hashing function
* SCRAM-SHA-512 - uses the SHA-512 hashing function

To prevent unauthorized access your Kafka password is stored as a secret value. While secret storage is recommended, you can choose to override this setting and store the password as plain text in the agent policy definition. Secret storage requires {fleet-server} version 8.12 or higher.

Note that this setting can also be stored as a secret value or as plain text for preconfigured outputs. See {kibana-ref}/fleet-settings-kb.html#_preconfiguration_settings_for_advanced_use_cases[Preconfiguration settings] in the {kib} Guide to learn more.

// ============================================================================

|
[id="kafka-output-authentication-ssl"]
**SSL**

| Authenticate using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. Provide the following details for your SSL certificate:

// Kafka SSL setting descriptions match Logstash SSL settings: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-settings.html#ls-output-settings

Client SSL certificate::
The certificate generated for the client. Copy and paste in the full contents of the certificate. This is the certificate that all the agents will use to connect to Kafka.
+
In cases where each client has a unique certificate, the local path to that certificate can be placed here. The agents will pick the certificate in that location when establishing a connection to Kafka.

Client SSL certificate key::
The private key generated for the client. This must be in PKCS 8 key. Copy and paste in the full contents of the certificate key. This is the certificate key that all the agents will use to connect to Kafka.
+
In cases where each client has a unique certificate key, the local path to that certificate key can be placed here. The agents will pick the certificate key in that location when establishing a connection to Kafka.
+
To prevent unauthorized access the certificate key is stored as a secret value. While secret storage is recommended, you can choose to override this setting and store the key as plain text in the agent policy definition. Secret storage requires {fleet-server} version 8.12 or higher.
+
Note that this setting can also be stored as a secret value or as plain text for preconfigured outputs. See {kibana-ref}/fleet-settings-kb.html#_preconfiguration_settings_for_advanced_use_cases[Preconfiguration settings] in the {kib} Guide to learn more.

// ============================================================================

|
**Server SSL certificate authorities**

| The CA certificate to use to connect to Kafka. This is the CA used to generate the certificate and key for Kafka. Copy and paste in the full contents for the CA certificate.

This setting is optional. This setting is not available when the authentication `None` and `Plaintext` options are selected.

Click **Add row** to specify additional certificate authories.

// ============================================================================

|
**Verification mode**
// from beats/libbeat/docs/shared-ssl-config.asciidoc

| Controls the verification of server certificates. Valid values are:

`Full`::
Verifies that the provided certificate is signed by a trusted
authority (CA) and also verifies that the server's hostname (or IP address)
matches the names identified within the certificate.

`None`::
Performs _no verification_ of the server's certificate. This
mode disables many of the security benefits of SSL/TLS and should only be used
after cautious consideration. It is primarily intended as a temporary
diagnostic mechanism when attempting to resolve TLS errors; its use in
production environments is strongly discouraged.

`Strict`::
Verifies that the provided certificate is signed by a trusted
authority (CA) and also verifies that the server's hostname (or IP address)
matches the names identified within the certificate. If the Subject Alternative
Name is empty, it returns an error.

`Certificate`::
Verifies that the provided certificate is signed by a
trusted authority (CA), but does not perform any hostname verification.

The default value is `Full`. This setting is not available when the authentication `None` and `Plaintext` options are selected.

[discrete]
== Partitioning settings

The number of partitions created is set automatically by the Kafka broker based on the list of topics. Records are then published to partitions either randomly, in round-robin order, or according to a calculated hash.

[cols="2*<a"]
|===

|
[id="kafka-output-partitioning-random"]
**Random**

| Publish records to Kafka output broker event partitions randomly. Specify the number of events to be published to the same partition before the partitioner selects a new partition.

// =============================================================================

|
[id="kafka-output-partitioning-roundrobin"]
**Round robin**

| Publish records to Kafka output broker event partitions in a round-robin fashion. Specify the number of events to be published to the same partition before the partitioner selects a new partition.

// =============================================================================

|
[id="kafka-output-partitioning-hash"]
**Hash**

| Publish records to Kafka output broker event partitions based on a hash computed from the specified list of fields. If a field is not specified, the Kafka event key value is used.

|===

[discrete]
== Topics settings

Use these options to dynamically set the Kafka topic for each {agent} event.

[cols="2*<a"]
|===

|
[id="kafka-output-topics-default"]
**Default topic**

| Set the default topic to use. Click **Add topic processor** to specify additional processors to set topics based on event contents.

// =============================================================================

|
[id="kafka-output-topics-processors"]
**Processors**

| For each processor provide a condition, the event value to check against, and the resulting Kafka topic.

Refer to <<processor-conditions,conditions>> in the {agent} processor syntax for condition descriptions. Currently the `equals`, `contains`, and `regexp` conditions are available.

Events that don't match against any defined processor are set to the default topic.

Processors are applied in the order that they appear, from top to bottom.

The value field must be specified in a `[key]: value` format with both the key and value being strings. For example, `host.port: 2000` or `message: Test`.

NOTE: Quotation marks are included in the match string. That is, they should be specified in the key or value only if it's expected for them to be included in the events being matched against. So, `message: "error"` will match against the literal string `"error"`, including the quotations marks, and not against the unquoted `error`. This applies to both single (') and double (") quotation marks.

As an example for setting up your processors, you might want to route log events based on severity. To do so, you can specify a default topic for all events not matched by other processors:

* `%{[fields.log_topic]}`.

Then, create a processor to route critical events:

* Condition: `Contains`
* Value: `message: “CRITICAL”`  
* Topic: `critical-%{[agent.version]}`

And create another processor to route error events:

* Condition: `Contains`
* Value: `message: “ERR”`
* Topic: `error-%{[agent.version]}`

All non-critical and non-error events will then route to the default `%{[fields.log_topic]}` topic.

|===

[discrete]
== Header settings

A header is a key-value pair, and multiple headers can be included with the same key. Only string values are supported. These headers will be included in each produced Kafka message.

[cols="2*<a"]
|===

|
[id="kafka-output-headers-key"]
**Key**

| The key to set in the Kafka header.

// =============================================================================

|
[id="kafka-output-headers-value"]
**Value**

| The value to set in the Kafka header.

Click **Add header** to configure additional headers to be included in each Kafka message.

// =============================================================================

|
[id="kafka-output-headers-clientid"]
**Client ID**

| The configurable ClientID used for logging, debugging, and auditing purposes. The default is `Elastic`. The Client ID is part of the protocol to identify where the messages are coming from.

|===

[discrete]
== Compression settings

You can enable compression to reduce the volume of Kafka output.

[cols="2*<a"]
|===

|
[id="kafka-output-compression-codec"]
**Codec**

| Select a compression codec to use. Supported codecs are `snappy`, `lz4` and `gzip`.

// =============================================================================

|
[id="kafka-output-compression-level"]
**Level**

| For the `gzip` codec you can choose a compression level. The level must be in the range of `1` (best speed) to `9` (best compression).

Increasing the compression level reduces the network usage but increases the CPU usage. The default value is 4.

|===

[discrete]
== Broker settings

Configure timeout and buffer size values for the Kafka brokers.

[cols="2*<a"]
|===

|
[id="kafka-output-broker-timeout"]
**Broker timeout**

| The maximum length of time a Kafka broker waits for the required number of ACKs before timing out (see the `ACK reliability` setting further in). The default is 30 seconds.

// =============================================================================

|
[id="kafka-output-broker-reachability-timeout"]
**Broker reachability timeout**

| The maximum length of time that an {agent} waits for a response from a Kafka broker before timing out. The default is 30 seconds.

// =============================================================================

|
[id="kafka-output-broker-ack-reliability"]
**ACK reliability**

| The ACK reliability level required from broker. Options are:

* Wait for local commit
* Wait for all replicas to commit
* Do not wait

The default is `Wait for local commit`.

Note that if ACK reliability is set to `Do not wait` no ACKs are returned by Kafka. Messages might be lost silently in the event of an error.

|===

[discrete]
== Other settings

[cols="2*<a"]
|===

|
[id="kafka-output-other-key"]
**Key**

| An optional formatted string specifying the Kafka event key. If configured, the event key can be extracted from the event using a format string.

See the link:https://kafka.apache.org/intro#intro_topics[Kafka documentation] for the implications of a particular choice of key; by default, the key is chosen by the Kafka cluster.

// =============================================================================

|
[id="kafka-output-other-proxy"]
**Proxy**

| Select a proxy URL for {agent} to connect to Kafka.
To learn about proxy configuration, refer to <<fleet-agent-proxy-support>>.

// =============================================================================

|
[id="kafka-output-advanced-yaml-setting"]
**Advanced YAML configuration**

| YAML settings that will be added to the Kafka output section of each policy
that uses this output. Make sure you specify valid YAML. The UI does not
currently provide validation.

See <<kafka-output-settings-yaml-config>> for descriptions of the available settings.

// =============================================================================

|
[id="kafka-output-agent-integrations"]
**Make this output the default for agent integrations**

| When this setting is on, {agent}s use this output to send data if no other
output is set in the <<agent-policy,agent policy>>.

// =============================================================================

|
[id="kafka-output-agent-monitoring"]
**Make this output the default for agent monitoring**

| When this setting is on, {agent}s use this output to send <<monitor-elastic-agent,agent monitoring data>> if no other output is set in the <<agent-policy,agent policy>>.
