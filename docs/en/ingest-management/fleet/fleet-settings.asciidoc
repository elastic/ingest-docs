[[fleet-settings]]
= {fleet} settings

NOTE: The settings described here are configurable through the {fleet} UI. Refer to
{kibana-ref}/fleet-settings-kb.html[{fleet} settings in {kib}] for a list of
settings that you can configure in the `kibana.yml` configuration file.

// lint ignore fleet
On the **Settings** tab in **Fleet**, you can configure global settings available
to all {agent}s enrolled in {fleet}. This includes {fleet-server} hosts and
output settings.

[[fleet-server-hosts-setting]]
== {fleet-server} host settings

Click **Edit hosts** and specify the host URLs your {agent}s will use to connect
to a {fleet-server}.

TIP: If the **Edit hosts** option is grayed out, {fleet-server} hosts
are configured outside of {fleet}. For more information, refer to
{kibana-ref}/fleet-settings-kb.html[{fleet} settings in {kib}].

Not sure if {fleet-server} is running? Refer to <<fleet-server>>.

On self-managed clusters, you must specify one or more URLs.

On {ecloud}, this field is populated automatically. If you are using
Azure Private Link, GCP Private Service Connect, or AWS PrivateLink and
enrolling the {agent} with a private link URL, ensure that this setting is
configured. Otherwise, {agent} will reset to use a default address instead of
the private link URL.

NOTE: If a URL is specified without a port, {kib} sets the port to `80` (http)
or `443` (https).

By default, {fleet-server} is typically exposed on the following ports:

`8220`::
Default {fleet-server} port for self-managed clusters

`443` or `9243`::
Default {fleet-server} port for {ecloud}. View the {fleet} **Settings** tab
to find the actual port that's used.

IMPORTANT: The exposed ports must be open for ingress and egress in the firewall and
networking rules on the host to allow {agent}s to communicate with {fleet-server}.

Specify multiple URLs (click **Add row**) to scale out your deployment and provide
automatic failover. If multiple URLs exist, {fleet} shows the first provided URL
for enrollment purposes. Enrolled {agent}s will connect to the URLs in round
robin order until they connect successfully. 

When a {fleet-server} is added or removed from the list, all agent policies
are updated automatically.

**Examples:**

* `https://192.0.2.1:8220`
* `https://abae718c1276457893b1096929e0f557.fleet.eu-west-1.aws.qa.cld.elstc.co:443`
* `https://[2001:db8::1]:8220`

[[output-settings]]
== Output settings

Add or edit output settings to specify where {agent}s send data. {agent}s
use the default output if you don't select an output in the agent policy.


NOTE: The {ecloud} internal output is locked and cannot be edited. This
output is used for internal routing to reduce external network charges when
using the {ecloud} agent policy. It also provides visibility for
troubleshooting on {ece}.

To add or edit an output:

. Go to **{fleet} -> Settings**.

. Under **Outputs**, click **Add output** or **Edit**.
+
image::images/fleet-add-output-button.png[{fleet} Add output button]
+
The **Add new output** UI opens.

. Set the output name and type.

. Specify settings for the output type you selected:
+
* <<es-output-settings>>
* <<ls-output-settings>>
* <<kafka-output-settings>>
* <<remote-elasticsearch-output>>

. Click **Save and apply settings**.

TIP: If the options for editing an output are grayed out, outputs
are configured outside of {fleet}. For more information, refer to
{kibana-ref}/fleet-settings-kb.html[{fleet} settings in {kib}].

[discrete]
[[fleet-agent-binary-download-settings]]
== Agent binary download settings

{agent}s must be able to access the {artifact-registry} to download
binaries during upgrades. By default {agent}s download artifacts from the
artifact registry at `https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/`.

For {agent}s that cannot access the internet, you can specify agent binary
download settings, and then configure agents to download their artifacts from
the alternate location. For more information about running {agent}s in a
restricted environment, refer to <<air-gapped>>.

To add or edit the source of binary downloads:

. Go to **{fleet} -> Settings**.
. Under **Agent Binary Download**, click **Add agent binary source** or **Edit**.
. Set the agent binary source name.
. For **Host**, specify the address where you are hosting the artifacts
repository.
. (Optional) To make this location the default, select
**Make this host the default for all agent policies**. {agent}s
use the default location if you don't select a different agent binary source
in the agent policy.

[discrete]
[[proxy-settings]]
== Proxies

You can specify a proxy server to be used in {fleet-server}, {agent} outputs, or for any agent binary download sources. 
For full details about proxy configuration refer to <<fleet-agent-proxy-support,Using a proxy server with {agent} and {fleet}>>.
