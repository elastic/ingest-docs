[[monitor-elastic-agent]]
= Monitor {agent}s

{fleet} provides built-in capabilities for monitoring your fleet of {agent}s.
In {fleet}, you can:

* <<view-agent-status>>
* <<view-agent-details>>
* <<view-agent-activity>>
* <<view-agent-logs>>
* <<collect-agent-diagnostics>>
* <<view-agent-metrics>>
* <<change-agent-monitoring>>
* <<external-elasticsearch-monitoring>>
* <<fleet-alerting>>

Agent monitoring is turned on by default in the agent policy unless you
turn it off. Want to turn off agent monitoring to stop collecting logs and
metrics? See <<change-agent-monitoring>>.

Want to receive an alert when your {agent} health status changes?
Refer to <<fleet-alerting>> and our <<fleet-alerting-example,alerting example>>.

For more detail about how agents communicate their status to {fleet}, refer to <<agent-health-status,{agent} health status>>.

[[view-agent-status]]
= View agent status overview

To view the overall status of your {fleet}-managed agents, in {kib}, go to
**Management -> {fleet} -> Agents**.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/kibana-fleet-agents.png[Agents tab showing status of each {agent}]

IMPORTANT: The **Agents** tab in **{fleet}** displays a maximum of 10,000 agents, shown on 500 pages with 20 rows per page.
If you have more than 10,000 agents, we recommend using the filtering and sorting options described in this section to narrow the table to fewer than 10,000 rows.

{agent}s can have the following statuses:

|===

| *Healthy* | {agent}s are enrolled and checked in. There are no agent policy updates or automatic agent binary updates in progress, but the agent binary may still be out of date. {agent}s continuously check in to the {fleet-server} for required updates. 

| *Unhealthy* | {agent}s have errors or are running in a degraded state. An agent will be reported as `unhealthy` as a result of a configuration problem on the host system. For example, an {agent} may not have the correct permissions required to run an integration that has been added to the {agent} policy. In this case, you may need to investigate and address the situation.

| *Updating* | {agent}s are updating the agent policy, updating the binary, or enrolling or unenrolling from {fleet}.

| *Offline* | {agent}s have stayed in an unhealthy status for a period of time. Offline agent's API keys remain valid. You can still see these {agent}s in the {fleet} UI and investigate them for further diagnosis if required.

| *Inactive* | {agent}s have been offline for longer than the time set in your <<set-inactivity-timeout,inactivity timeout>>. These {agent}s are valid, but have been removed from the main {fleet} UI. 

| *Unenrolled* | {agent}s have been manually unenrolled and their API keys have been removed from the system. You can <<unenroll-elastic-agent,unenroll>> an offline {agent} using {agent} actions if you determine it's offline and no longer valid. 

These agents need to re-enroll in {fleet} to be operational again.

|===

The following diagram shows the flow of {agent} statuses:

image::images/agent-status-diagram.png[Diagram showing the flow of Fleet Agent statuses]

To filter the list of agents by status, click the **Status** dropdown and select
one or more statuses.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/agent-status-filter.png[Agent Status dropdown with multiple statuses selected]

For advanced filtering, use the search bar to create structured queries
using {kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[{kib} Query Language]. For example, enter
`local_metadata.os.family : "darwin"` to see only agents running on macOS.

You can also sort the list of agents by host, last activity time, or version, by clicking on the table headings for those fields. 

To perform a bulk action on more than 10,000 agents, you can select the **Select everything on all pages** button.

[discrete]
[[view-agent-metrics]]
= View the {agent} metrics dashboard

When agent monitoring is configured to collect metrics (the default), you can
use the **[Elastic Agent] Agent metrics** dashboard in {kib} to view details
about {agent} resource usage, event throughput, and errors. This information can
help you identify problems and make decisions about scaling your deployment.

To view agent metrics:

. In {fleet}, open the **Agents** tab.

. In the **Host** column, click the agent's name.

. On the **Agent details** tab, verify that **Monitor metrics** is enabled. If
it's not, refer to <<change-agent-monitoring>>.

. Click **View more agent metrics** to navigate to the
**[Elastic Agent] Agent metrics** dashboard.
+
[role="screenshot"]

[[change-agent-monitoring]]
= Change {agent} monitoring settings

Agent monitoring is turned on by default in the agent policy. To change agent
monitoring settings for all agents enrolled in a specific agent policy:

. In {fleet}, open the **Agent policies** tab.

. Click the agent policy to edit it, then click **Settings**.

. Under **Agent monitoring**, deselect (or select) one or both of these
settings: **Collect agent logs** and **Collect agent metrics**.

. Under **Advanced monitoring options** you can configure additional settings including an HTTP monitoring endpoint, diagnostics rate limiting, and diagnostics file upload limits. Refer to <<change-policy-enable-agent-monitoring,configure agent monitoring>> for details.

. Save your changes.

To turn off agent monitoring when creating a new agent policy:

. In the **Create agent policy** flyout, expand **Advanced options**.

. Under **Agent monitoring**, deselect **Collect agent logs** and
**Collect agent metrics**.

. When you're done configuring the agent policy, click **Create agent policy**.

[discrete]
[[external-elasticsearch-monitoring]]
= Send {agent} monitoring data to a remote {es} cluster

You may want to store all of the health and status data about your {agents} in a remote {es} cluster, so that it's separate and independent from the deployment where you use {fleet} to manage the agents.

To do so, follow the steps in <<remote-elasticsearch-output>>. After the new output is configured, follow the steps to update the {agent} policy and make sure that the **Output for agent monitoring** setting is enabled. {agent} monitoring data will use the remote {es} output that you configured.

[discrete]
[[fleet-alerting]]
= Enable alerts and ML jobs based on {fleet} and {agent} status

You can access the health status of {fleet}-managed {agents} and other {fleet} settings through internal {fleet} indices. This enables you to leverage various applications within the {stack} that can be triggered by the provided information. For instance, you can now create alerts and machine learning (ML) jobs based on these specific fields. Refer to the {kibana-ref}/alerting-getting-started.html[Alerting documentation] or see the <<fleet-alerting-example,example>> on this page to learn how to define rules that can trigger actions when certain conditions are met.

This functionality allows you to effectively track an agent's status, and identify scenarios where it has gone offline, is experiencing health issues, or is facing challenges related to input or output.

The following datastreams and fields are available.

Datastream::
`metrics-fleet_server.agent_status-default`
+
This data stream publishes the number of {agents} in various states.
+
**Fields**
+
 * `@timestamp`
 * `fleet.agents.total` - A count of all agents
 * `fleet.agents.enrolled` - A count of all agents currently enrolled
 * `fleet.agents.unenrolled` - A count of agents currently unenrolled
 * `fleet.agents.healthy` - A count of agents currently healthy
 * `fleet.agents.offline` - A count of agents currently offline
 * `fleet.agents.updating` - A count of agents currently in the process of updating
 * `fleet.agents.unhealthy` - A count of agents currently unhealthy
 * `fleet.agents.inactive` - A count of agents currently inactive
+
NOTE: Other fields regarding agent status, based on input and output health, are currently under consideration for future development.

Datastream::
`metrics-fleet_server.agent_versions-default`
+
This index publishes a separate document for each version number and a count of enrolled agents only.
+
**Fields**
+
 * `@timestamp`
 * `fleet.agent.version` - A keyword field containing the version number
 * `fleet.agent.count` - A count of agents on the specified version

[[fleet-alerting-example]]
== Example: Enable an alert for offline {agent}s

You can set up an alert to notify you when one or more {agent}s goes offline:

. In {kib}, navigate to **Management > Stack Management > Rules**.
. Click **Create rule**.
. Select **Elasticsearch query** as the rule type.
. Choose a name for the rule, for example `Elastic Agent status`.
. Select **KQL or Lucene** as the query type.
. Select `DATA VIEW metrics-*` as the data view.
. Define your query, for example: `fleet.agents.offline >= 1`.
. Set the alert group, threshold, and time window. For example:
** WHEN: `count()`
** OVER: `all documents`
** IS ABOVE: `0`
** FOR THE LAST `5 minutes`
+
This will generate an alert when one or more agents are reported by the `fleet.agents.offline` field over the last five minutes to be offline.
. Set the number of documents to send, for example:
** SIZE: 100
. Set **Check every** to the frequency at which the rule condition should be evaluated. The default setting is one minute.
. Select an action to occur when the rule conditions are met. For example, to set the alert to send an email when an alert occurs, select the Email connector type and specify:
** Email connector: `Elastic-Cloud-SMTP`
** Action frequency: `For each alert` and `On check intervals`
** Run when: `Query matched`
** To: <the recipient email address>
** Subject: <the email subject line>
. Click **Save**.

The new rule will be enabled and an email will be sent to the specified recipient when the alert conditions are met.

From the **Rules** page you can select the rule you created to enable or disable it, and to view the rule details including a list of active alerts and an alert history.
