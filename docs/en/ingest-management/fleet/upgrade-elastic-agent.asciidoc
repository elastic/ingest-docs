TIP: Want to upgrade a standalone agent instead? See <<upgrade-standalone>>.

With {fleet} upgrade capabilities, you can view and select agents that are out
of date, and trigger selected agents to download, install, and run the new
version. You can trigger upgrades to happen immediately, or specify a
maintenance window during which the upgrades will occur. If your {stack}
subscription level supports it, you can schedule upgrades to occur at a specific
date and time.

In most failure cases the {agent} may retry an upgrade after a short wait. The
wait durations between retries are: 1m, 5m, 10m, 15m, 30m, and 1h. During this
time, the {agent} may show up as "retrying" in the {fleet} UI. As well, if agent
upgrades have been detected to have stalled, you can restart the upgrade process
for a <<restart-upgrade-single,single agent>> or in bulk for
<<restart-upgrade-multiple,multiple agents>>.

This approach simplifies the process of keeping your agents up to date. It also
saves you time because you don't need third-party tools or processes to
manage upgrades.

By default, {agent}s require internet access to perform binary upgrades from
{fleet}. However, you can host your own artifacts repository and configure
{agent}s to download binaries from it. For more information, refer to
<<air-gapped>>.

NOTE: The upgrade feature is not supported for upgrading DEB/RPM packages or
Docker images.

For a detailed view of the {agent} upgrade process and the interactions between {fleet}, {agent}, and {es}, refer to the link:https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/blob/main/docs/upgrades.md[Communications amongst components] diagram in the `elastic-agent` GitHub repository.

can perform the following upgrade-related actions:

[options,header]

. From the **Actions** menu, choose to upgrade the agents.

. In the Upgrade agents window, select an upgrade version.

. Select the amount of time available for the maintenance window. The upgrades
are spread out uniformly across this maintenance window to avoid exhausting
network resources.
+
To force selected agents to upgrade immediately when the upgrade is
triggered, select **Immediately**. Avoid using this setting for batches of more
than 10 agents.

. Upgrade the agents.

subscriptions].

. In the Upgrade window, select an upgrade version.

. Select a maintenance window. For more information, refer to
<<rolling-agent-upgrade>>.

. Set the date and time when you want the upgrade to begin.

. Click **Schedule**.

[[view-upgrade-status]]
== View upgrade status

On the Agents tab, when you trigger an upgrade, agents that are upgrading have the status `Updating` until the upgrade is complete, and then the status changes back to `Healthy`.

Agents on version 8.12 and higher that are currently upgrading additionally show a detailed upgrade status indicator.

image::images/upgrade-states.png[Detailed state of an upgrading agent]

The following table explains the upgrade states in the order that they can occur.

.{agent} upgrade states
|===
| State | Description

| Upgrade requested | {agent} has received the upgrade notice from {fleet}.
| Upgrade scheduled | {agent} has received the upgrade notice from {fleet} and the upgrade will start at the indicated time.
| Upgrade downloading | {agent} is downloading the archive containing the new version artifact.
| Upgrade extracting | {agent} is extracting the new version artifact from the downloaded archive.
| Upgrade replacing | {agent} is currently replacing the former, pre-upgrade agent artifact with the new one.
| Upgrade restarting | {agent} has been replaced with a new version and is now restarting in order to apply the update.
| Upgrade monitoring | The newly upgraded {agent} has started and is being monitored for errors.
| Upgrade rolled back | The upgrade was unsuccessful. {agent} is being rolled back to the former, pre-upgrade version.
| Upgrade failed | An error has been detected in the newly upgraded {agent} and the attempt to roll the upgrade back to the previous version has failed.

|===

Under routine circumstances, an {agent} upgrade happens quickly. You typically will not see the agent transition through each of the upgrade states. The detailed upgrade status can be a very useful tool especially if you need to diagnose the state of an agent that may have become stuck, or just appears to have become stuck, during the upgrade process.

Beside the upgrade status indicator, you can hover your cursor over the information icon to get more detail about the upgrade.

Note that when you upgrade agents from versions below 8.12, the upgrade details are not provided.

When upgrading many agents, you can fine tune the maintenance window by
viewing stats and metrics about the upgrade:

. On the **Agents** tab, click the host name to view agent details. If you
don't see the host name, try refreshing the page.
. Click **View more agent metrics** to open the **[{agent}] Agent metrics** dashboard.

If an upgrade appears to have stalled, you can <<restart-upgrade-single,restart it>>.

If an upgrade fails, you can view the agent logs to find the reason:

.. In {fleet}, in the Host column, click the agent's name.
.. Open the **Logs** tab.
.. Search for failures.

[discrete]
[[restart-upgrade-single]]
== Restart an upgrade for a single agent

An {agent} upgrade process may sometimes stall. This can happen for various
reasons, including, for example, network connectivity issues or a delayed shutdown.

When an {agent} upgrade has been detected to be stuck, a warning indicator
appears on the UI. When this occurs, you can restart the upgrade from either the
*Agents* tab on the main {fleet} page or from the details page for any individual
agent.

Note that there is a required 10 minute cooldown period in between restart attempts.
After launching a restart action you need to wait for the cooldown to complete before
initiating another restart.

Restart from main {fleet} page:

. From the **Actions** menu next to an agent that is stuck in an `Updating`
state, choose **Restart upgrade**.
. In the **Restart upgrade** window, select an upgrade version and click
**Upgrade agent**.

Restart from an agent details page:

. In {fleet}, in the **Host** column, click the agent's name. On the
**Agent details** tab, a warning notice appears if the agent is detected to have
stalled during an upgrade.
. Click *Restart upgrade*.
. In the **Restart upgrade** window, select an upgrade version and click
**Upgrade agent**.

[discrete]
[[restart-upgrade-multiple]]
== Restart an upgrade for multiple agents

When the upgrade process for multiple agents has been detected to have stalled,
you can restart the upgrade process in bulk. As with
<<restart-upgrade-single,restarting an upgrade for a single agent>>,
a 10 minute cooldown period is enforced between restarts.

. On the **Agents** tab, select any set of the agents that are indicated to be stuck, and click **Actions**.
. From the **Actions** menu, select **Restart upgrade <number> agents**.
. In the **Restart upgrade...** window, select an upgrade version.
. Select the amount of time available for the maintenance window. The upgrades
are spread out uniformly across this maintenance window to avoid exhausting
network resources.
+
To force selected agents to upgrade immediately when the upgrade is
triggered, select **Immediately**. Avoid using this setting for batches of more
than 10 agents.
. Restart the upgrades.
