.After upgrading to an 8.x version {agent} rolls back to version 7.17.23.
[%collapsible]
====

*Details*

A problem has been found that after {agent} is upgraded from version 7.17.23 to an 8.x version, after a period of time the agent rolls back to version 7.17.23.

*Impact* +

This issue appears to affect only {agent} version 7.17.23. As a workaround, it's recommended to avoid upgrading your agents to 7.17.23 if you plan to upgrade to 8.x before 7.17.24 is released.

If you already have {agent}s on that version and you plan to upgrade, when version 7.17.24 is available you can first upgrade to that version, and from there you can upgrade to an 8.x version as usual.

.Fail to bootstrap {fleet-server} with self-signed certificates, impacting {ess} and self-managed clusters.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details*
An issue has been discovered in {fleet-server} that causes it to fail to bootstrap with self-signed certificates. This is due to an update in {beats} dependencies where the certificate validation was completely rewritten.
The issue also prevents bootstrapping {fleet-server} in {ess}.

This issue is planned to be fixed in version 7.17.21. We recommend that if you're using {fleet-server} you wait until the next version to upgrade.
