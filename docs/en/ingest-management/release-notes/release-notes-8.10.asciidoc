[[security-update-8.10.3]]
=== Security updates

* **Fleet Server Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File (ESA-2023-20)**
+
An issue was discovered in Fleet Server >= v8.10.0 and < v8.10.3 where Agent enrollment tokens are being inserted into the Fleet Serverâ€™s log file in plain text.
+
These enrollment tokens could allow someone to enroll an agent into an agent policy, and potentially use that to retrieve other secrets in the policy including for Elasticsearch and third-party services. Alternatively a threat actor could potentially enroll agents to the clusters and send arbitrary events to Elasticsearch.
+
The issue is resolved in 8.10.3.

IMPORTANT: The <<known-issue-3375-v8100,known issue>> that prevents successful upgrades in an air-gapped environment for {agent} versions 8.9.0 to 8.10.2 has been resolved in this release. If you're using an air-gapped environment, we recommend installing version 8.10.3 or any higher version to avoid not being unable to upgrade.

.PGP key download fails in an air-gapped environment
[%collapsible]
====

*Details*

IMPORTANT: If you're using an air-gapped environment, we recommended installing version 8.10.3 or any higher version, to avoid being unable to upgrade.

Starting from version 8.9.0, when {agent} tries to perform an upgrade, it first verifies the binary signature with the key bundled in the agent.
This process has a backup mechanism that will use the key coming from `https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elastic-agent` instead of the one it already has.

In an air-gapped environment, the agent won't be able to download the remote key and therefore cannot be upgraded. 

*Impact* +

For the upgrade to succeed, the agent needs to download the remote key from a server accessible from the air-gapped environment. Two workarounds are available.

*Option 1*

If an HTTP proxy is available to be used by the {agents} in your {fleet}, add the proxy settings using environment variables as explained in <<host-proxy-env-vars,Proxy Server connectivity using default host variables>>.
Please note that you need to enable HTTP Proxy usage for `artifacts.elastic.co` to bypass this problem, so you can craft the `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` environment variables to be used exclusively for it.

*Option 2*

As the upgrade URL is not customizable, we have to "trick" the system by pointing `https://artifacts.elastic.co/` to another host that will have the file.

The following examples require a server in your air-gapped environment that will expose the key you will have downloaded from `https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elastic-agent``.

_Example 1: Manual_

Edit the {agent} server hosts file to add the following content:

[source,sh]
----
<YOUR_HOST_IP> artifacts.elastic.co
----

The Linux hosts file path is `/etc/hosts`.

Windows hosts file path is `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.

_Example 2: Puppet_

[source,yaml]
----
host { 'elastic-artifacts':
  ensure       => 'present'
  comment      => 'Workaround for PGP check'
  ip           => '<YOUR_HOST_IP>'
}
----

_Example 3: Ansible_

[source,yaml]
----
- name  : 'elastic-artifacts'
  hosts : 'all'
  become: 'yes'  

  tasks:
    - name: 'Add entry to /etc/hosts'

.Filtering Elastic Agents in Kibana generates an "Error fetching agents" message
[%collapsible]
====

*Details*

A {kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[KQL query] in a Fleet search field now returns a `400` error when the query is not valid.

Previously, the search fields would accept any type of query, but with the merge of {kibana-pull}161064[#161064] any type of KQL sent to {fleet} needs to have a valid field name, otherwise it returns an error.

*Cause* +

Entering an invalid KQL query on one of the {fleet} KQL search fields or through the API produces the error.

Affected search fields in the {fleet} UI:

* Agent list
* Agent policies
* Enrollment Keys

Affected endpoints in the <<fleet-api-docs>> (these are the endpoints that accept the parameter `ListWithKuery`):

* `GET api/fleet/agents`
* `GET api/fleet/agent_status`
* `GET api/fleet/agent_policies`
* `GET api/fleet/package_policies`
* `GET api/fleet/enrollment_api_keys`
* `GET api/fleet/agent_status`

*Impact* +

To avoid getting the `400` error, the queries should be valid.

For instance, entering the query `8.10.0` results in an error. The correct query should be: `local_metadata.agent.version="8.10.0"`.

As another example, when viewing the *Agents* tab in *Fleet*, typing a hostname such as `a0c8c88ef2f5` in the search field results in an error. The correct query should have the correct field name, taken from among the allowed ones, for example `local_metadata.host.hostname: a0c8c88ef2f5`.

The list of available field names is visible by clicking on any of the search fields.
