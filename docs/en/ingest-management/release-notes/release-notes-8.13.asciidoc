.Removes conditional topics for Kafka outputs

[[breaking-176443]]
.Most Fleet installed integrations are now read-only and labelled with a *Managed* tag in the Kibana UI 
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Integration content installed by {fleet} is no longer editable. This content is tagged with *Managed* in the {kib} UI, and is Elastic managed. This content cannot be edited or deleted, however managed visualizations, dashboards, and saved searches can be cloned. The clones can be customized.
When cloning a dashboard the cloned panels become entirely independent copies that are unlinked from the original configurations and dependencies. 
Managed content relating to specific visualization editors such as Lens, TSVB, and Maps, the clones retain the original reference configurations. The same applies to editing any saved searches in a managed visualization.
For more information, refer to ({kibana-pull}172393[#172393]).

.The behavior of `queue.mem.flush.min_events` has been simplified.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The behavior of `queue.mem.flush.min_events` has been simplified. It now serves as a simple maximum on the size of all event batches. There are no longer performance implications in its relationship to `bulk_max_size`.

For more information, refer to ({beats-pull}37795[#37795]).
