[[new-features-8.14.0]]
=== New features

The 8.14.0 release added the following new and notable features.

{fleet}::
* (Technical preview) Kibana administrators can now assign granular subfeature privileges for {fleet}, {agents}, agent policies, and settings to user roles. ({kibana-pull}179889[#179889]).
* The `index.mapping.total_fields.limit` field on integration index templates is now set to 1000 by default instead of 10000. If an integration data stream includes more than 500 fields, the limit will be increased to 10000. ({kibana-pull}178398[#178398])
* `index_template.mappings.subobjects: false` is now the default for custom integration data streams to avoid subobject and scalar mapping conflicts. ({kibana-pull}178397[#178397])
* Fleet no longer sets `index.query.default_field` on integration component templates, favoring the Elasticsearch default value of `index.query.default_field: *`. This allows queries without a field specified to be run against all integration fields by default. ({kibana-pull}178020[#178020])
* Allow managed content installed by {fleet} to be deleted. Note: this content will be recreated when an integration is upgraded or reinstalled. ({kibana-pull}179113[#179113])

{agent}::
* The Kubernetes secrets provider has been improved to update a Kubernetes secret  when the secret value changes. {agent-pull}4371[#4371] {agent-issue}4168[#4168]
* The OpenTelemetry link:https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/filterprocessor[filterprocessor] is now available to users running {agent} in `otel` mode. {agent-pull}4708[#4708]
* The OpenTelemetry link:https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/elasticsearchexporter[elasticsearchexporter] is now available to users running {agent} in `otel` mode. {agent-pull}4707[#4707]

[discrete]
[[enhancements-8.14.0]]
=== Enhancements

{fleet}::
* Add `time_series_dimension: true` to dynamic field mappings defined in integrations with `dimension: true`. ({kibana-pull}180023[#180023])
* Allow additional CPU metrics to be collected when requesting diagnostics from an agent. ({kibana-pull}179819[#179819])
* Add new "advanced settings" section to agent policy settings page sourced from configuration. ({kibana-pull}179795[#179795])
* Add an Elastic Defend advanced policy option for pruning capability arrays. ({kibana-pull}179766[#179766])
* The "agent activity" flyout now includes several new features: ({kibana-pull}179161[#179161])
** A "review errors" button now appears above the agent listing table when new activity events are loaded that include errors. Clicking the button will open the activity flyout with these errors shown.
** Agent activity now supports pagination. Click the "show more" button at the bottom of the list to load additional activity events.
** Agent activity from a given date can now be loaded by clicking the "Go to date" button and selecting a date. 
* Surface `unhealthy_reason` in agent metrics that indicates which component (input/output/other) is causing an agent to be considered unhealthy. ({kibana-pull}178605[#178605])
* Add a warning which is displayed when trying to upgrade agent to version > max {fleet-server} version. ({kibana-pull}178079[#178079])

{fleet-server}::
* When running in `agent` mode, {fleet-server} will use the APMConfig settings of the expected input if it's set over the settings in `inputs[0].server.instrumentation`. This should make it easier for managed agents to inject APM configuration data. {fleet-server-pull}3277[#3277] {fleet-server-issue}2868[#2868]
* Allow specification in the {fleet-server} settings for whether or not a diagnostics bundle should contain additional CPU metrics. {fleet-server-pull}3333[#3333] {agent-issue}3491[#3491]
* Allow {fleet} to set the trace level for logging. {fleet-server-pull}3350[#3350]

{agent}::
* The CPU and memory usage of the internal monitoring {beats} is now included in the agent CPU and memory usage calculations in {fleet}. {agent-pull}4326[#4326] {agent-issue}4082[#4082]
* Add the optional CPU profile collection to the {fleet} diagnostics action handler. {agent-pull}4394[#4394] {agent-issue}3491[#3491]
* Enable `--unprivileged` on Mac OS, allowing {agent} to run as an unprivileged user. {agent-pull}4362[#4362] {agent-issue}3867[#3867]
* Make the `enroll` command more stable by handling temporary server errors. {agent-pull}4523[#4523] {agent-issue}4513[#4513]
* Reduce the overall download and on-disk size of {agent}. {agent-pull}4516[#4516] {agent-issue}3364[#3364]
** Linux: -43% reduction from 1800MB to 1018MB compared to 8.13.4 when extracted
** MacOS: -44% reduction from 1100MB to 619MB compared to 8.13.4 when extracted
** Windows: -43% reduction from 891MB to 504MB compared to 8.13.4 when extracted
* Remove `cloud-defend` from Linux `.tar.gz` archives; it now appears only in Docker images where it is required. {agent-pull}4584[#4584]
* Reduce the disk usage of {agent} self-monitoring logs shipped to {fleet} by 16% by dropping "Non-zero metrics..." logs automatically. {agent-pull}4633[#4633] {agent-issue}4252[#4252]

* Add an `unhealthy_reason` value (`input`/`output`/`other`) to {fleet-server} metrics published regularly in agent documents. {agent-pull}3338[#3338]
* Update endpoints to return a `400` status code instead of `500` for bad requests. {fleet-server-pull}3407[#3407] {fleet-server-issue}3110[3110]

* Use `IgnoreCommas` in default configuration options to correct parse functions used as part of variable substitutions. {agent-pull}4436[#4436]

* Reduce the disk usage of {agent} self-monitoring metrics shipped to {fleet} by 13% by dropping the {beats} `state` metricset. {agent-pull}4579[#4579] {agent-issue}4153[#4153]
