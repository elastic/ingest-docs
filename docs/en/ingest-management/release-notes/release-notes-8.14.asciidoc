[[enhancements-8.14.0]]
=== Enhancements

{fleet}::

{fleet-server}::
* When running in `agent` mode, {fleet-server} will use the APMConfig settings of the expected input if it's set over the settings in `inputs[0].server.instrumentation`. This should make it easier for managing agents to inject APM configuration data. {fleet-server-pull}3277[3277] {fleet-server-issue}2868[2868]
* Allow specification in the {fleet-server} settings for whether or not a diagnostics bundle should contain additional CPU metrics. {fleet-server-pull}3333[3333] {agent-issue}3491[3491]
* Allow {fleet} to set the trace level for logging. {fleet-server-pull}3350[3350]



{agent}::
//* Move the control socket path to always be inside of the top level of the {agent} installation directory. {agent-pull}3909[#3909] {agent-issue}3840[#3840]

[discrete]
[[bug-fixes-8.14.0]]
=== Bug fixes

//{fleet}::
//* Fixes a bug where secret values were not deleted on output type change ({kibana-pull}178964[#178964]).

{fleet-server}::
* Respond with a `429` error, instead of a misleading `401 unauthorized response`, when an Elasticsearch API key authentication returns a `429` error. {fleet-server-pull}3278[#3278]
* Add an `unhealthy_reason` value (`input`/`output`/`other`) to {fleet-server} metrics published regularly in agent documents. {agent-pull}3338[#3338]
* Update endpoints to return `400` status code instead of `500` for bad requests. {fleet-server-pull}3407[#3407] {fleet-server-issue}3110[3110]

{agent}::
//* Fix component control protocol to allow checkin to be chunked across multiple messages. Fixes errors related to the gRPC max message size being exceeded. {agent-pull}3884[#3884] {agent-issue}
