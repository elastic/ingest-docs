.Azure EventHub input for {agent} fails to start on Windows
[%collapsible]
====

*Details*

The Azure EventHub input fails to start on {agent} version 8.15 running on Windows. 
The {agent} status will be reported as unhealthy.
See {beats} issue link:https://github.com/elastic/beats/issues/40608[#40608] for details.

*Impact* +

If you're using {agent} on Windows with any integration which makes use of the Azure EventHub input, we recommend not upgrading {agent} to version 8.15.0 and instead waiting for a later release. A fix is planned for version 8.15.1.
