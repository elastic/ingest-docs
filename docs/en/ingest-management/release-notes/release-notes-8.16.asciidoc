=== Enhancements

In this release we've introduced an image based on the hardened link:https://github.com/wolfi-dev/[Wolfi] image to provide additional security to our self-managed customers, and improve our supply chain security posture. Wolfi-based images require Docker version 20.10.10 or higher.

.{fleet} UI listing shows "No agent found"
[%collapsible]
====

*Details*

In the {fleet} UI in {kib}, the listing {agents} might show "No agent found" with a toast message "Error fetching agents" or "Agent policy ... not found".

This error can happen if the {agents} being searched and listed in the UI are using an {agent} policy which doesn't exist.

*Impact* +

As a workaround for the issue, you can upgrade your {stack} to verion 8.16.1. The issue has been resolved by {kib} link:https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/199325[#199325].

For other examples, refer to {agent} link:https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/issues/5952#issuecomment-2475044465[issue #5952].

This problem occurs when {agent} notifies {fleet} to audit the uninstall process.

*Impact* +

As a workaround, we recommend trying again to uninstall the agent.

[[new-features-8.16.0]]
=== New features

The 8.16.0 release Added the following new and notable features.

{fleet}::
* Add support for content-only packages in integrations UI. {kibana-pull}195831[#195831]
* Add advanced agent monitoring options for HTTP endpoint and diagnostics. {kibana-pull}193361[#193361]
* Add support for periodic unenrollment of inactive agents. Once an {agent} transitions to an `inactive` state and after a configurable timeout has expired, the agent will be unenrolled. {kibana-pull}189861[#189861]
* Add support for dynamic topics to the Kafka output. This allows the Kafka output to write to a topic which is dynamically set in an event field. {kibana-pull}192720[#192720]
* Add support for GeoIP processor databases in Ingest Pipelines. {kibana-pull}190830[#190830]
* Add support for reusable/shareable integration policies. This feature allows you to create integrations policies that can be shared with multiple {agent} policies, thereby reducing the number of integrations policies that you need to actively manage. {kibana-pull}187153[#187153]
* Add support for integration-level outputs. This feature enables you to send integration data to a specific output, overwriting the output defined in the {agent} Policy. {kibana-pull}189125[#189125]


{fleet-server}::
* Add `/api/fleet/agents/:id/audit/unenroll` API that an {agent} or Endpoint process may use to report that an agent was uninstalled or unenrolled to {fleet}. {fleet-server-pull}3818[#3818] {agent-issue}484[#484]
* Add a `secret_paths` attribute to the policy data sent to agents. This attribute is a list of keys that {fleet-server} has replaced with a reference to a secret value. {fleet-server-pull}3908[#3908] {fleet-server-issue}3657[#3657]

{agent}::
* Uninstalling a {fleet}-managed {agent} instance will now do a best-effort attempt to notify {fleet-server} of the agent removal so the agent status appears correctly in the {fleet} UI (related to {fleet-server-pull}3818[#3818] above). {agent-pull}5302[#5302] {agent-issue}484[#484]
* Introduce a Helm Chart for deploying {agent} in Kubernetes. {agent-pull}5331[#5331] {agent-issue}3847[#3847]
* Remove support for the experimental shippers feature. {agent-pull}5308[#5308] {agent-issue}4547[#4547]
* Add the GCP Asset Inventory input to Cloudbeat. {agent-pull}5422[#5422]
* Add support for passphrase protected mTLS client certificate key during install/enroll. {agent-pull}5494[#5494] {agent-issue}5489[#5489]
* Elastic Defend now accepts a passphrase protected client certificate key for mTLS. {agent-pull}5542[#5542] {agent-issue}5490[#5490]
* Add a Kustomize template to enable hints-based autodiscovery by default when deploying standalone {agent} in a Kubernetes cluster. This also removes `root` privileges from the init container. {agent-pull}5643[#5643]

[[enhancements-8.16.0]]
=== Enhancements

{fleet}::

* Show `+build` versions for {agent} upgrades. {kibana-pull}192171[#192171]
* Add format parameter to `agent_policies` APIs. {kibana-pull}191811[#191811]
* Add toggles for `agent.monitoring.http.enabled` and `agent.monitoring.http.buffer.enabled` to agent policy advanced settings. {kibana-pull}190984[#190984]
* Support integration policies without agent policy references (aka orphaned integration policies). {kibana-pull}190649[#190649]
* Allow `traces` to be added to the `monitoring_enabled` array in Agent policies. {kibana-pull}189908[#189908]
* Add setup technology selector to the Add Integration page. {kibana-pull}189612[#189612]

{fleet-server}::
* Alter the checkin API to remove attributes set by the audit or unenroll API (follow-up to {fleet-server-pull}3818[#3818] above). {fleet-server-pull}3827[#3827] {agent-issue}484[#484]
* Enable warnings for configuration options that have been deprecated throughout the 8.x lifecycle. {fleet-server-pull}3901[#3901]

{agent}::
* Re-enable support for Elastic Defend on Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2. {agent-pull}5429[#5429]
* Include the correct Elastic License 2.0 file in build artifacts and packages. {agent-pull}5464[#5464]
* Add the `pprofextension` to the {agent} OTel collector.  {agent-pull}5556[#5556]
* Update the base container image from Ubuntu 20.04 to Ubuntu 24.04. {agent-pull}5644[#5644] {agent-issue}5501[#5501]
* Redact values from the `elastic-agent inspect` command output for any keys in the `secret_paths` array. {agent-pull}5621[#5621]
* Redact secret paths in files written in {agent} diagnostics bundles. {agent-pull}5745[#5745]
* Update the versions of OpenTelemetry Collector components from v0.111.0/v1.17.0 to v0.112.0/v1.18.0. {agent-pull}5838[#5838]

* Rollover if dimension mappings changed in dynamic templates. {kibana-pull}192098[#192098]
