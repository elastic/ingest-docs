.Inaccurate option to upgrade across major releases appears in {fleet} UI
[%collapsible]
====

*Details*

In late 8.x releases, there's a bug in the {fleet} UI that causes `9.0.0` to appear as an option for {agent} upgrades. This option results in an error when selected, as upgrades across major releases are not supported for {agent}. For example, an agent can't be upgraded to version 9.0 while {kib} and {fleet-server} are on version 8.x.

The {agent} upgrade is not selectable:

The {fleet-server} upgrade is selectable, with an inconsistent UI state and error on submit:

In the 9.x releases, the option that appears in the UI for an upgrade across a major release should be ignored.

.{kib} out of memory crashes on 1 GB {ecloud} {kib} instances using {elastic-sec} view
[%collapsible]
====

*Details*

{ecloud} deployments that use the smallest available {kib} instance size of 1 GB may crash due to out of memory errors when the Security UI is loaded.

*Impact* +

The root cause is inefficient memory allocation, and this is exacerbated when the prebuilt security rules package is installed on the initial load of the {elastic-sec} UI.

As a workaround, you can upgrade your deployment to 8.17.1 in which this issue has been resolved by https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/208869[#208869] and https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/208475[#208475].
