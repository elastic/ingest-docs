.Inaccurate option to upgrade across major releases appears in {fleet} UI
[%collapsible]
====

*Details*

In late 8.x releases, there's a bug in the {fleet} UI that causes `9.0.0` to appear as an option for {agent} upgrades. This option results in an error when selected, as upgrades across major releases are not supported for {agent}. For example, an agent can't be upgraded to version 9.0 while {kib} and {fleet-server} are on version 8.x.

The {agent} upgrade is not selectable:

image::images/upgrade-agent-not-selectable.png[{agent} upgrade is not selectable]

The {fleet-server} upgrade is selectable, with an inconsistent UI state and error on submit:

image::images/upgrade-fleet-server-inconsistent-state.png[{fleet-server} inconsistent UI state]

*Impact* +

In the 9.x releases, the option that appears in the UI for an upgrade across a major release should be ignored.
