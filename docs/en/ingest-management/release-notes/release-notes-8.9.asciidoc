.PGP key download fails in an air-gapped environment
[%collapsible]
====

*Details*

IMPORTANT: If you're using an air-gapped environment, we recommended installing version 8.10.3 or any higher version, to avoid being unable to upgrade.

Starting from version 8.9.0, when {agent} tries to perform an upgrade, it first verifies the binary signature with the key bundled in the agent.
This process has a backup mechanism that will use the key coming from `https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elastic-agent` instead of the one it already has.

In an air-gapped environment, the agent won't be able to download the remote key and therefore cannot be upgraded. 

*Impact* +

For the upgrade to succeed, the agent needs to download the remote key from a server accessible from the air-gapped environment. Two workarounds are available.

*Option 1*

If an HTTP proxy is available to be used by the {agents} in your {fleet}, add the proxy settings using environment variables as explained in <<host-proxy-env-vars,Proxy Server connectivity using default host variables>>.
Please note that you need to enable HTTP Proxy usage for `artifacts.elastic.co` to bypass this problem, so you can craft the `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` environment variables to be used exclusively for it.

*Option 2*

As the upgrade URL is not customizable, we have to "trick" the system by pointing `https://artifacts.elastic.co/` to another host that will have the file.

The following examples require a server in your air-gapped environment that will expose the key you will have downloaded from `https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elastic-agent``.

_Example 1: Manual_

Edit the {agent} server hosts file to add the following content:

[source,sh]
----
<YOUR_HOST_IP> artifacts.elastic.co
----

The Linux hosts file path is `/etc/hosts`.

Windows hosts file path is `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.

_Example 2: Puppet_

[source,yaml]
----
host { 'elastic-artifacts':
  ensure       => 'present'
  comment      => 'Workaround for PGP check'
  ip           => '<YOUR_HOST_IP>'
}
----

_Example 3: Ansible_

[source,yaml]
----
- name  : 'elastic-artifacts'
  hosts : 'all'
  become: 'yes'  

  tasks:
    - name: 'Add entry to /etc/hosts'
      lineinfile:
        path: '/etc/hosts'
        line: '<YOUR_HOST_IP> artifacts.elastic.co'

.PGP key download fails in an air-gapped environment

[[breaking-changes-8.9.0]]
=== Breaking changes

Breaking changes can prevent your application from optimal operation and
performance. Before you upgrade, review the breaking changes, then mitigate the
impact to your application.

[discrete]
[[breaking-2890]]
.Status command has been changed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The {agent} `status` command has been changed so that the default human output now uses a list format and summaries output.

*Impact* +
Full human output can be obtained with the new `full` option.
For for information, refer to {agent-pull}2890[#2890].
====

[discrete]
[[breaking-2531]]
.API default error code is now 500.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Previously, when {fleet-server} encountered an unexpected error it resulted in a `Bad Request` response.

*Impact* +
Now, any unexpected error returns an `Internal Server Error` response while keeping most of the current behavior
unchanged. On expected failure paths (for example, Agent Inactive, Missing Agent ID, Missing Auth Header) a `Bad Request` response is returned. For more information, refer to {fleet-server-pull}2531[#2531].
====

[discrete]
[[breaking-ecs-hostname]]
.`host.name` field changed to ECS lowercase format.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In {agent} output the `host.name` field has been changed to lowercase to match Elastic Common Schema (ECS) guidelines. The agent name is also reported in lowercase (`AGENT-name` becomes `agent-name`).

*Impact* +
After upgrading {agent} to version 8.9.0 or higher, any case-sensitive searches may result in false-positive alerts. For example, a case-sensitive search based on the upper-case `AGENT-name` could result in an alert such as `system.load.1 reported no data in the last 5m for AGENT-name`. After upgrading, you may need to manually clear alerts and adjust some searches to match the new `host.name` format.
