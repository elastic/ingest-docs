[[certificates-rotation]]
= Rotate SSL/TLS CA certificates

As part of managing secure connections between {fleet} and {agent} components, Certificate Authority (CA) certificates need to be renewed from time to time. Refer to the following steps to rotate certificates securing the following connections:

* <<certificates-rotation-agent-fs>>
* <<certificates-rotation-fs-es>>
* <<certificates-rotation-agent-es>>

== Expiring {fleet-server} CA, supporting connections from {agent}

{agent} communicates with {fleet-server} to receive policies and to check for updates.

To renew an expiring CA certificate on {fleet-server}:

There are two methods to renew an expiring CA certificate on {es} for connections from {fleet-server}. The first method requires {agent} to re-enroll with {fleet-server} one or more times. The second method avoids re-enrollment and requires overwriting existing CA files with a new certificate.

**Option 1: To renew an expiring CA certificate on {fleet-server} with {agent} re-enrollments:**

Using this method, the {agent} with an old or expiring CA configured will be re-enrolled with {fleet-server} using a new CA.

. Update the elastic agent with the NEW Fleet Server CA:
+
The {agent} should already have a CA configured. Use the <<elastic-agent-enroll-command,`elastic-agent enroll`>> command to re-enroll the agent with an updated, comma separated set of CAs to use.
+
[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent enroll \
  --url=<Fleet-Server-URL> \
  --enrollment-token=<enrollment-token> \
  ... \  
  --certificate-authorities <original_CA, new_CA>
----
+
A new agent enrollment will cause a new agent to appear in {fleet}. This may be considered disruptive, however the old agent entry will transition to offline. A new agent enrollment is required in order for the {fleet-server} configuration to be modified to accept multiple certificate authorities.
+
At this point, all TLS connections are still relying on the original CA that was provided (`original_CA`) in order to authenticate {fleet-server} certificates.

. Rotate the certificates on {fleet-server}:
+
This procedure will reissue new certificates based on the new CA. Re-enroll {fleet-server} with all the new certificates:
+
[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent enroll ... 
  --url=<Fleet-Server-URL> \
  --enrollment-token=<enrollment-token> \
  ... \
--fleet-server-cert <new_cert> --certificate-authorities <new_CA>
----
+
This will cause the TLS connections to the {agents} to reset and will load the relevant new CA and certificates to the {fleet-server} configuration.

. The {agents} will automatically establish new TLS connections as part of their normal operation:
+
The new CA (`new_CA`) on the agent installed in Step 1 will be used to authenticate the certificates used by {fleet-server}.
+
Note that if the original CA (`original CA`) was compromised, then it may need to be removed from the agent's CA list. To achieve this you need to enroll the agent again:
+
[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent enroll ... 
  --url=<Fleet-Server-URL> \
  --enrollment-token=<enrollment-token> \
  ... \
--certificate-authorities <new_CA>
----

**Option 2: To renew an expiring CA certificate on {es} without {agent} re-enrollments:**

Option 1 results in multiple {agent} enrollments. Another option to avoid multiple enrollments is to overwrite the files with the new CA or certificate. This method uses a single file with multiple CAs that can be replaced.

To use this option it is assumed that:

* {agent}s have already been enrolled using a file that contains the Certificate Authority:
+
[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent enroll ... 
  --url=<Fleet-Server-URL> \
  --enrollment-token=<enrollment-token> \
  ... \
  --certificate-authorities=<CA.pem>
----

* The {agent} running {fleet-server} has already been enrolled with the following secure connection options, where each option points to files that contain the certificates and keys:
+
[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent enroll ... 
  --url=<Fleet-Server-URL> \
  --enrollment-token=<enrollment-token> \
  ... \
  --certificate-authorities=<CA.pem>
  --fleet-server-cert=<fleet-cert.pem>
  --fleet-server-cert-key=<key.pem>
----

To update the {agent} and {fleet-server} configurations:

. Update the configuration with the new CA by changing the content of `CA.pem` to include the new CA.
+
[source,shell]
----
cat new_ca.pem >> CA.pem
----

. Restart the {agents}. Note that this is not a re-enrollment. Restarting will force the {agents} to reload the CAs.
+
[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent restart
----

. For the {agent} that is running {fleet-server}, overwrite the original `certificate`, `certificate-key`, and the `certificate-authority` with the new ones to use.
+
[source,shell]
----
cat new-cert.pem > cert.pem
cat new-key.pem > key.pem
cat new_ca.pem > CA.pem
----

. Restart the {agent} that is running {fleet-server}.
+
[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent restart
----

. If the original certificate needs to be removed from the {agents}, overwrite the `CA.pem` with the new CA only:
+
[source,shell]
----
cat new_ca.pem > CA.pem 
----

. Finally, restart the {agents} again.
+
[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent restart

[[certificates-rotation-fs-es]]
== Expiring {es} CA, supporting incoming connections from {fleet-server}

{fleet-server} communicates with {es} to send status information to {fleet} about {agent}s and to retrieve updated policies to ship out to all {agent}s enrolled in a given policy. The case of the {es} CA expiring occurs only when {fleet-server} is <<fleet-deployment-models,deployed on-premise>>.

To renew an expiring CA certificate on {es} for connections from {fleet-server}:

. Update the {fleet-server} with the new {fleet-server} CA:
+
The {agent} running {fleet-server} should already have a CA configured. Use the <<elastic-agent-enroll-command,`elastic-agent enroll`>> command to re-enroll the agent running {fleet-server} with an updated, comma separated set of CAs to use.
+
[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent enroll \
  --fleet-server-es=<Elasticsearch-URL> \
  --fleet-server-service-token=<service-token> \
  ... \  
  --fleet-server-es-ca <original_ES_CA, new_ES_CA>
----
+
A new agent enrollment will cause two {fleet-server} agents to appear in {fleet}. This may be considered disruptive, however the old agent entry will transition to offline. A new agent enrollment is required in order for the {fleet-server} configuration to be modified to accept multiple certificate authorities.
+
At this point, all TLS connections are still relying on the original CA that was provided (`original_ES_CA`) in order to authenticate {es} certificates. Re-enrolling the {fleet-server} will cause the agents going through that {fleet-server} to also reset their TLS, but they will be re-established as required.

. Rotate the certificates on {es}.
+
{es} will use new certificates based on the new {es} CA. Since the {fleet-server} has the original and the new {es} CAs in a chain, it will accept original and new certificates from {es}.
+
Note that if the original {es} CA (`original_ES CA`) was compromised, then it may need to be removed from the {fleet-server}'s CA list. To achieve this you need to enroll the {fleet-server} agent again (if re-enrollment is a concern then use a file to hold the certificates and certificate-authority):
+
[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent enroll \
  --fleet-server-es=<Elasticsearch-URL> \
  --fleet-server-service-token=<service-token> \
  ... \  
  --fleet-server-es-ca <new_ES_CA>

[[certificates-rotation-agent-es]]
== Expiring {es} CA, supporting incoming connections from {agent}

Uses configuration information from a policy delivered by {fleet-server}, {agent} collects data and sends it to {es}.

To renew an expiring CA certificate on {es} for connections from {agent}:


. Specify the new Elasticsearch CA trusted fingerprint in the definition of the Elasticsearch output in the Fleet settings (see picture)
.. This is the SHA-256 fingerprint (hash) of the certificate authority used to self-sign Elasticsearch certificates. This fingerprint will be used to verify self-signed certificates presented by Elasticsearch 
.. If this certificate is present in the chain during the handshake, it will be added to the certificate_authorities list and the handshake will continue normally.
