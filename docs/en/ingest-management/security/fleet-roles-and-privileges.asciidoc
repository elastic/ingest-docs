[[fleet-roles-and-privileges]]
= Roles and privileges

Beginning with {stack} version 8.14, you can take much more granular control over the level of access that different users have to features managed by {fleet}. This is very useful when you have users within your organization who use {fleet} for different purposes, and for whom read or write privileges should be limited accordingly.

For both `Fleet` and `Integrations` as a whole, privileges can be set to:

`all`:: Grants full read-write access.
`read`:: Grants read-only access.
`none`:: No access is granted.

You can take advantage of these available privilege settings by:

* <<fleet-roles-and-privileges-built-in,Using an {es} built-in role>>
* <<fleet-roles-and-privileges-create,Creating a new role>>
* <<fleet-roles-and-privileges-sub-features,Customize sub-feature privileges for {fleet}>>

== Built-in roles

{es} comes with built-in roles that include default privileges.

`editor`::
The built-in `editor` role grants the following privileges, supporting full read-write access to {fleet} and Integrations:

* {Fleet}: `all`
* Integrations: `all`

`viewer`::
The built-in `viewer` role grants the following privileges, supporting read-only access to {fleet} and Integrations:

* {Fleet}: `none`  // IS THIS TRUE, OR IS IT NOW "READ"?
* Integrations: `read`

You can also <<fleet-roles-and-privileges-create,create a new role>> that can be assigned to a user to grant more specific levels of access to {fleet} and Integrations.

== Create a role for {fleet}

To create a new role with full access to use and manage {fleet} and Integrations:

. In {kib}, go to **Management -> Stack Management**.
. In the **Security** section, select **Roles**.
. Select **Create role**.
. Specify a name for the role.
. Leave the {es} settings at their defaults, or refer to {ref}/security-privileges.html[Security privileges] for descriptions of the available settings.
. In the {kib} section, select **Add Kibana privilege**.
. In the **Spaces** menu, select *** All Spaces**. Since many Integrations assets are shared across spaces, the users needs the {kib} privileges in all spaces.
. Expand the **Management** section.
. Set **Fleet** privileges to **All**.
. Set **Integrations** privileges to **All**.
