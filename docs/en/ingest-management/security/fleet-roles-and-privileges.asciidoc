[[fleet-roles-and-privileges]]
= Roles and privileges

Beginning with {stack} version 8.14, you can take much more granular control over the level of access that users have to features managed by {fleet}. This is useful when people in your organization access {fleet} for different purposes, and for whom you'd like to fine-tune the set of features that can be viewed and actions that can be performed.

For both `Fleet` and `Integrations`, privileges can be set to:

`all`:: Grants full read-write access.
`read`:: Grants read-only access.
`none`:: No access is granted.

Take advantage of these privileges by:

* <<fleet-roles-and-privileges-built-in,Using an {es} built-in role>>
* <<fleet-roles-and-privileges-create,Creating a new role>>

For more granular access control, select a custom set of privileges for individual {fleet} features:

* <<fleet-roles-and-privileges-sub-features,Customize sub-feature privileges for {fleet}>>

== Built-in roles

{es} comes with built-in roles that include default privileges.

`editor`::
The built-in `editor` role grants the following privileges, supporting full read-write access to {fleet} and Integrations:

* {Fleet}: `all`
* Integrations: `all`

`viewer`::
The built-in `viewer` role grants the following privileges, supporting read-only access to {fleet} and Integrations:

* {Fleet}: `none`  // IS THIS TRUE, OR IS IT NOW "READ"?
* Integrations: `read`

You can also <<fleet-roles-and-privileges-create,create a new role>> that can be assigned to a user to grant more specific levels of access to {fleet} and Integrations.

== Create a role for {fleet}

To create a new role with access to {fleet} and Integrations:

. In {kib}, go to **Management -> Stack Management**.
. In the **Security** section, select **Roles**.
. Select **Create role**.
. Specify a name for the role.
. Leave the {es} settings at their defaults, or refer to {ref}/security-privileges.html[Security privileges] for descriptions of the available settings.
. In the {kib} section, select **Add Kibana privilege**.
. In the **Spaces** menu, select *** All Spaces**. Since many Integrations assets are shared across spaces, the users needs the {kib} privileges in all spaces.
. Expand the **Management** section.

.. To create a read-only user for {fleet} and Integrations, set both **Fleet** and **Integrations** privileges to **Read**.

.. You can also expand the **Fleet** menu to define more specialized access to {fleet} by feature. This limits or enables access to the {fleet} UI for the role, based on your selections. Refer  <<fleet-roles-and-privileges-sub-features,customize access to {fleet} features>> for details.

Once a new role has been created, you can edit it any time from the **Roles** page.

== Customize sub-feature privileges for {fleet}

When you <<fleet-roles-and-privileges-create,create or edit a role>>, you can fine-tune the access level that it has for different features in {fleet}. The {fleet} UI varies depending on the privileges granted to the role.

=== Example 1: Read access for {agents}

Set `Read` access privileges for {agents} only:

* Agents: `Read`
* Agent policies: `None`
* Settings: `None`

The {fleet} UI shows only the **Agents** and **Data streams** tabs. The **Enrollment tokens**, **Uninstall tokens**, and **Settings** columns are hidden. 

The set of actions available for an agent are limited to viewing the agent, and requesting a diagnostics bundle.
