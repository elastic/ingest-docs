[[fleet-roles-and-privileges]]
= Required roles and privileges

Beginning with {stack} version 8.1, you no longer require the built-in `elastic` superuser credentials to use {fleet} and Integrations.

Assigning the {kib} feature privileges `Fleet` and `Integrations` grants access to these features:

`all`:: Grants full read-write access.
`read`:: Grants read-only access.
`none`:: No access is granted.

Take advantage of these privilege settings by:

* <<fleet-roles-and-privileges-built-in,Using an {es} built-in role>>
* <<fleet-roles-and-privileges-create,Creating a new role>>

== Built-in roles

{es} comes with built-in roles that include default privileges.

`editor`::
The built-in `editor` role grants the following privileges, supporting full read-write access to {fleet} and Integrations:

* {Fleet}: `all`
* Integrations: `all`

`viewer`::
The built-in `viewer` role grants the following privileges, supporting read-only access to {fleet} and Integrations:

* {Fleet}: `read`
* Integrations: `read`

You can also create a new role that can be assigned to a user, in order to grant more specific levels of access to {fleet} and Integrations.

== Create a role for {fleet}

To create a new role with access to {fleet} and Integrations:

. In {kib}, go to **Management -> Stack Management**.
. In the **Security** section, select **Roles**.
. Select **Create role**.
. Specify a name for the role.
. Leave the {es} settings at their defaults, or refer to {ref}/security-privileges.html[Security privileges] for descriptions of the available settings.
. In the {kib} section, select **Assign to space**.
. In the **Spaces** menu, select *** All Spaces**. Since many Integrations assets are shared across spaces, the users need the {kib} privileges in all spaces.
. Expand the **Management** section.
. Choose the access level that you'd like the role to have with respect to {fleet} and integrations:

.. To grant the role full access to use and manage {fleet} and integrations, set both the **Fleet** and **Integrations** privileges to `All`.
