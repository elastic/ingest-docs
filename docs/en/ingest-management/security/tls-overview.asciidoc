[[tls-overview]]
= One-way and mutual TLS certifications flow

This page provides an overview of the relationship between the various certificates and certificate authorities (CAs) that you configure for {fleet-server} and {agent}, using the `elastic-agent install` TLS command options.

[[one-way-tls-connection]]
== Simple one-way TLS connection

The following `elastic-agent install` command configures a {fleet-server} with the required certificates and certificate authorities to enable one-way TLS connections between the components involved:

[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent install --url=https://your-fleet-server.elastic.co:443 \
--certificate-authorities=/path/to/fleet-ca \
--fleet-server-es=https://es.elastic.com:443 \
--fleet-server-es-ca=/path/to/es-ca \
--fleet-server-cert=/path/to/fleet-cert \
--fleet-server-cert-key=/path/to/fleet-cert-key \
--fleet-server-service-token=FLEET-SERVER-SERVICE-TOKEN \
--fleet-server-policy=FLEET-SERVER-POLICY-ID \
--fleet-server-port=8220
----

{agent} is configured with `fleet-ca` as the certificate authority that it needs to validate certificates from {fleet-server}. 

During the TLS connection setup, {fleet-server} presents its certificate `fleet-cert` to the agent and the agent (as a client) uses `fleet-ca` to validate the presented certificate.

{fleet-server} also establishes a secure connection to an {es} cluster. In this case, {fleet-server} is configured with the certificate authority from the {es} `es-ca`. {es} presents its certificate, `es-cert`, and {fleet-server} validates the presented certificate using the certificate authority `es-ca`.

[[mutual-tls-connection]]
== Mutual TLS connection

The following `elastic-agent install` command configures a {fleet-server} with the required certificates and certificate authorities to enable mutual TLS connections between the components involved:

[source,shell]
----
elastic-agent install --url=https://your-fleet-server.elastic.co:443 \
--certificate-authorities=/path/to/fleet-ca,/path/to/agent-ca \
--elastic-agent-cert=/path/to/agent-cert \
--elastic-agent-cert-key=/path/to/agent-cert-key \
--fleet-server-es=https://es.elastic.com:443 \
--fleet-server-es-ca=/path/to/es-ca \
--fleet-server-es-cert=/path/to/fleet-es-cert \
--fleet-server-es-cert-key=/path/to/fleet-es-cert-key \
--fleet-server-cert=/path/to/fleet-cert \
--fleet-server-cert-key=/path/to/fleet-cert-key \
--fleet-server-client-auth=required \
--fleet-server-service-token=FLEET-SERVER-SERVICE-TOKEN \
--fleet-server-policy=FLEET-SERVER-POLICY-ID \
--fleet-server-port=8220

As with the <<one-way-tls-connection,one-way TLS example>>, {agent} is configured with `fleet-ca` as the certificate authority that it needs to validate certificates from the {fleet-server}. {fleet-server} presents its certificate `fleet-cert` to the agent and the agent (as a client) uses `fleet-ca` to validate the presented certificate.

To establish a mutual TLS connection, the agent presents its certificate, `agent-cert`, and {fleet-server} validates this certificate using the `agent-ca` that it has stored in memory.

{fleet-server} can also establish a mutual TLS connection to the {es} cluster. In this case, {fleet-server} is configured with the certificate authority from the {es} `es-ca` and uses this to validate the certificate `es-cert` presented to it by {es}.

Note that you can also configure mutual TLS for {fleet-server} and {agent} <<mutual-tls-cloud-proxy,using a proxy>>.
